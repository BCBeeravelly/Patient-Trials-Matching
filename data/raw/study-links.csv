NCT06626295,Exercise-snacks for Breaking the Sedentary Lifestyle and Improving the Physical Fitness of Obese Adolescents?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06626295,"The management of a person with obesity involves long-term behavioral changes with a balanced diet in both quantity and quality, along with the adoption of a more active lifestyle: increasing physical activities and reducing sedentary behaviors. The school setting has been identified as a favorable environment for interventions aimed at reducing and interrupting the time adolescents spend sitting and preventing the associated negative health consequences.

Recently, very short (\&lt; 1 minute) and intense exercises, called 'exercise-snacks,' have been reported to be effective in adults for 1) improving physical fitness over 6 weeks, and 2) improving vascular function and lowering blood glucose levels over a single day. Additionally, in adolescents with diabetes, they have been shown to reduce body fat. This raises the question of whether adding \&#39;exercise-snack\&#39; sessions to a multidimensional care program for hospitalized obese adolescents could further improve their physical fitness in the short and medium term.

The objective of this project is to compare the effects of a traditional multidimensional care program with the addition of 'exercise-snacks' to the same care program without \&#39;exercise-snacks\&#39; on the physical fitness, body composition, vascular function, and physical activity and sedentary behaviors of obese children in the short and medium term. Thirty-six obese adolescents will be included. The \&#39;exercise-snack\&#39; group will perform six exercise sessions per day for three weeks in addition to the standard care. The control group will receive only the standard care. Assessments of physical fitness, body composition, vascular health, and questionnaires on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cognitive restraint will be conducted at the beginning and end of the three-week program, as well as 1 and 3 months after the end of the program."
NCT06626243,"Analysis of RATS, VATS and Open Lung Resections After Neoadjuvant Chemo-immunotherapy in Patients Performed in Five Referred Centers",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06626243,"The study is a retrospective observational study. The study is designed to be multicentric and international and it will analyze medical records from selected patients diagnosed with locally advanced and resectable NSCLC who underwent lung resection by robotic, VATS and open approach after receiving neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy.

NCT06626204,Exploration and Application of Intelligent Difficult Airway Assessment Scheme,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06626204,"The study aims to explore the effectiveness of an intelligent difficult airway assessment protocol and its potential in clinical applications. The management of difficult airways is a critical task in anesthesiology, and poor management can lead to severe complications or even death. The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines a difficult airway as one that presents difficulties in mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of difficult airways is not low in patients undergoing general anesthesia, emphasizing the need for optimization of airway management strategies.

Preoperative airway assessment is an essential step in preventing complications associated with difficult airways. Currently, the modified Mallampati classification and the Cormack-Lehane grading are two commonly used assessment tools. However, these methods rely on the subjective judgment of clinicians and may have limitations in accuracy and consistency. With the development of artificial intelligence and telemedicine technologies, new assessment methods have become possible, offering more precise measurements and analysis of airway anatomy.

This study proposes an intelligent airway assessment system that combines phonation modulation and tongue position adjustment, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of assessments. The system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze oral images of subjects to predict airway difficulty. The study will also explore the correlation of this system with traditional assessment methods and establish a predictive model for difficult airways.

As a country with a large population, China has a significant demand for medical and health resources, especially in the fields of surgery and anesthesia. The diversity of China\&#39;s population may affect airway structure, thereby influencing airway management strategies. Therefore, conducting such research in China has important clinical significance and social value."

NCT06626152,Measuring Psychomotor Response to L-DOPA Challenge As a Biomarker for Outcomes in Late-Life Depression: a Pilot Feasibility Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06626152,"Background

Adults over the age of 60 with symptoms of major depressive disorder are said to have late-life depression (LLD), a condition that usually decreases a person's quality of life and is associated with other risks like physical frailty and dementia. A common feature of more severe LLD is psychomotor slowing, where a person's ability to think and move are impaired. For example, they might not be able to walk or process information as quickly, and they might have problems with their working memory.

Psychomotor slowing in LLD might be the result of a problem with the way a person's body produces or responds to the neurotransmitter dopamine. The drug Levodopa (L-DOPA), which can replace missing dopamine in the brain, has been used to treat to treat Parkinson's disease for many decades, and it might also affect psychomotor slowing in LLD.

Methods

In this study, participants are adults aged 60 years or older with moderate to severe major depression. Participants undergo the ""L-DOPA challenge""-a 2-week period where they receive a dose of L-DOPA once a day for the first week and a dose of L-DOPA twice a day for the second week. Before and after a participant completes the L-DOPA challenge, the study team assesses their depressive symptoms and psychomotor function. After the L-DOPA challenge, if a participant still shows signs of moderate or severe depression, they receive an antidepressant for 12 weeks.

Aims

The first aim of this study is to test the feasibility of the L-DOPA challenge-that is, whether most of the 50 participants recruited for this study will complete the L-DOPA challenge. For example, participants might have to withdraw if they can't make the daily visits to the research site to receive their L-DOPA medication, if they can't tolerate the medication's side effects, or if their depressive symptoms get significantly worse. Our hypothesis is that 80% of the participants will complete the L-DOPA challenge.

The second aim of the study is to see if L-DOPA affects participants' depressive symptoms, processing speed, and working memory. Our hypothesis is that L-DOPA response, measured as an improvement in gait speed, is associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in processing speed and working memory."
NCT06626113,Transduction of Sympathetic Neural Activity in Human Obesity Without Hypertension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06626113,"In addition to chronically elevated MSNA, there is a growing recognition that hypertension in states of insulin resistance and obesity may also be attributed to an increased vascular sensitivity to MSNA (1, 2, 13, 36-38). To study this phenomenon, we quantify vascular sensitivity to MSNA using an innovative, moment-to-moment assessment of the blood pressure response following individual bursts of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), (10, 11, 34, 37). This approach is termed 'sympathetic-vascular transduction (SVT).' We will examine the hypothesis that SVT is exaggerated in obesity and insulin resistance and is attenuated by suppression of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is the overabundance of reactive oxygen species and is another hallmark of hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. Oxidative stress can be safely reduced via intravenous infusion of ascorbic acid (Vit C) (4, 28). Therefore, we will use a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled approach to test the hypothesis that elevated SVT will be attenuated by suppression of oxidative stress via ascorbic acid I.V. infusion compared with saline I.V. infusion (placebo) in obese adults with insulin resistance. Our study will identify a unique mechanism that can be targeted to reduce the excessively high prevalence of hypertension and risk for CVD in obesity and insulin resistance."

NCT06625424,Effect of Short Sprint Interval Training With Active Recovery as Compared to Passive Recovery on Anaerobic Capacity in Non-athletic Population,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06625424,"Short Sprint Interval Training (SSIT) is a modified form of Sprint Interval Training (SIT) defined as ""small bouts of supramaximal exercise with recovery periods between them to increase peak oxygen uptake in spite of having a less amount of exercise volume"". SSIT was developed so that non- athletic population could also perform a training which was originally designed for athletes to increase anaerobic capacity. The benefit of this type of exercise is that it is time efficient and yields the result in short amount of time as compared to other type of exercises due to its vigorous nature. Moreover this sort of training is mostly performed in lab setting rather than on field, therefore the aim of this study is to determine the effect of short sprint interval training in a field with active recovery as compared to passive recovery on anaerobic capacity in non-athletic population."

NCT06625281,Effects of Epleys Maneuver Versus Semont-Plus Maneuver Combined with Brandt-Daroff Exercises on Dizziness and Quality of Life in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06625281,"Vestibular hypofunction can result in symptoms consisting of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia, gaze and gait instability, and impaired navigation and spatial orientation; thus, may negatively impact an individual\&#39;s quality of life, and ability to perform activities of daily living.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder which occurs with changing of the positions lying down, rolling over, climbing stairs, or looking up and down. The typical symptoms include dizziness, loss of balance, nystagmus, and nausea, limiting the daily activities of life and functional capacity.

Much research has been done to rule out the prime treatment for posterior canal-BPPV using vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT), Canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRM), and habituation exercises, but scarce literature renders the combination of maneuvers and exercises.

The current study will be used to determine and compare the effects of Epley\&#39;s maneuver Versus the Semont-Plus maneuver combined with Brandt-Daroff exercises on Dizziness and Quality of life in participants with pc-Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The participants having clinically diagnosed Posterior canal Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) will be selected in this study.

NCT06625203,"A Non-interventional, International, Multicentre Clinical Research Study to Build the Largest Collection of Multimodal Data (Including Clinical Data, Imaging Data and Omics Data) in Oncology",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06625203,"Cancer is amongst the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality. A major challenge in cancer treatment is the development of biology-informed, personalised treatment strategies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have shed further insights into disease biology and treatment pathways, thus identifying new, precision medicine-based therapeutic opportunities.

The biological mechanisms leading to cancer development and progression arise from complex and plastic networks of dysregulated cellular programs involving many signalling pathways and effector molecules. Cancer cells alter their surrounding environment via cell-cell interactions with non-tumor cells or by secreting cytokines, chemokines and other factors. This reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment (TME) is critical for cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, there are increasing studies that show that both innate and adaptive immune cell types contribute to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance when present within the TME. Understanding the crosstalk between cancer cells and the surrounding TME will inform on mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to treatment, including immunotherapy (IO) and targeted therapies.

Spatially resolved-Omics is an emerging field that characterises cell types by gene/protein expressions within their spatial context in the tissue organisation. Recent high profile spatial transcriptomics studies have uncovered specific cell identities that define the surrounding TME.

The MOSAIC study, a collaborative initiative across industry and top oncology hospitals, proposes to go way beyond current cancer molecular profiling projects by combining the generation and analysis of multiple data modalities (3 essential mandatory modalities: Clinical Data, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) microscopic image, Spatial transcriptomics; up to 3 high priority data modalities depending on technical feasibility and sample size: bulk Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing (RNAseq), bulk Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), Single-cell transcriptomics; and potentially other optional data modalities and follow-up experiments such as single-cell omics, immunohistochemistry and spatial proteomics or other molecular profiling of proteins and molecules) on a minimum of 2,000 tumour samples across a different cancer indications. This will generate broad molecular and cellular profiling data of the tumour and its microenvironment from cancer patients, integrated with clinical data, at an unprecedented scale and resolution.

This study will enroll patients diagnosed with one of the eligible cancer indications and for which a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample from already performed biopsy and/or surgical resection is available within their local pathology archive or their affiliate centers archives.

The MOSAIC study expects to have a strong impact for patients in terms of new targeted therapeutic drug discovery, identification of patient subgroups requiring either specific treatment or broader clinical care and identification of novel treatment response and resistance mechanisms."

Currently, blood culture takes 48 hours-5 days to complete. After starting antimicrobial treatment blood culture results are not reliable. As a result, empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy is mostly used. This implies possible antimicrobial over- or under treatment which is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance development. Early identification of the causative pathogen of sepsis will therefore have a major impact on the adequate treatment and reduction of high mortality rates. To date, there is not a single molecular diagnostic test available on the market to detect all putative causative bacterial pathogens of sepsis. In this study, the investigators will develop and validate a completely new molecular sepsis approach based on pathogen DNA detection, as an alternative to culture."

NCT06623565,Extensive Resection of Malignant Brain Tumors Using Advanced Imaging Techniques,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06623565,"Rationale: Patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or grade IV IDH-mutant astrocytoma have a very poor prognosis despite standard treatment consisting of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Diffuse infiltration of the brain by the tumor is thought to be one of the main causes of this therapy-resistance. In order to improve the surgical treatment, tumor regions with lower infiltration percentages need to be identified and resected during surgery, a so-called supramarginal resection. Currently, pre-operative T1 contrast enhanced weighted (T1c) MRI is used to identify the tumor for resection. We recently found the combination of apparent diffusion coefficient MRI and O-(2-\[ 18F\]fluoroethyl-)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (ADC/FET) to be significantly more accurate than T1c MRI alone in the detection of tumor infiltration. This makes ADC/FET a suitable candidate to guide supramarginal resection. Since FET PET is not as accessible and widely available as MRI, identification of an MRI based alternative could result in a more widespread implementation. Amide proton transfer chemical exchange saturation transfer (APT-CEST) MRI is a novel potential alternative for FET PET, since both measures are related to protein content.

Objective: In this project we aim to develop a safe and effective technique for ADC/FET guided resection of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and grade IV IDH-mutant astrocytoma. The safety concerns neurological deficits and time to start of adjuvant therapy, while the effectiveness is aimed at the extent of resection. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI and to assess whether APT-CEST MRI can serve as an alternative for FET PET for the detection of tumor infiltration.

Study design: prospective observational intervention study

Study population: 30 patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of an untreated high grade glioma (suspected for glioblastoma (IDH wildtype) or grade IV astrocytoma (IDH mutant)), who are eligible for a supramarginal surgical resection and adjuvant treatment according two neurosurgeons in consensus and who are in relatively good condition (Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) â‰¥70).

Intervention (if applicable): supramarginal ADC/FET-guided resection. To make sure that the standard treatment is always guaranteed, T1c MRI abnormalities will be included in the surgical target.

Main study parameters/endpoints: the main study endpoint is the optimization of ADC/FET-guided resection. Volumetric and percentual extent of resection, as measured with MRI and PET imaging, combined with surgery-induced morbidity will be used as outcome parameters. The secondary study parameters will be the histopathology-based diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI in comparison with FET PET, cognitive performance over time and progression free survival.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will undergo pre- and postoperative MRI scanning. This is also part of regular clinical care, except there are additional MRI sequences including APT CEST in the pre-operative and pre-radiotherapy MRI. There are no risks associated with MRI acquisition after MRI safety screening. Participants will furthermore undergo a pre- and postoperative FET PET. The risks associated with PET scanning are limited, and the radiation burden will remain below 10 mSv (ICRP62 category intermediate risk (level IIb)). During surgery, biopsies are performed from areas that will be resected, so these biopsies will not introduce any extra risk. A potential benefit is the possibility of the removal of more tumor tissue. A potential risk is the additional removal of healthy brain tissue with the risk of neurological damage, which is controlled by pre- and intraoperative techniques such as visualization of white matter tracts and mapping (both asleep and awake) of critical functions such as language and control of strength."

NCT06622733,Attitude Towards the Concept of CS on Demand,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06622733,"Caesarean section (CS) is a surgical procedure performed to facilitate delivery of the baby through an incision made on the mother's abdomen. Ideally, it is recommended in situations where normal vaginal delivery (VD) can pose risks to either the mother baby or both . In the western world women have only one or two children, while in the East or the Middle East, women are culturally coerced into having many children. Thus, they are more prone to multiple Cesarean deliveries in their lifetime \[1.2\]. ThisAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), since 1985, the acceptable percentage of worldwide C-sections has been 10-15% of all deliveries \[3\]. One of the most critical findings of the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that the Cesarean delivery rate has increased from 20.7% in 1995 to 31.6% in 2016 \[4 \]. It is important to mention that Cesarean deliveries are life-saving procedures when there are obstetrical indications.(5.6) Cesarean delivery indications include fetal malpresentation, multiple pregnancies, chorioamnionitis, arrested labour, oligohydramnios, cord prolapse, cephalo-pelvic disorders, and medical diseases such as eclampsia and HELPP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome .the number of patients undergoing Cesarean delivery for non-obstetric reasons has rapidly increased. This could be due to many factors influencing the patients' decisions, including possible fetal outcomes concerning beliefs in some cultures and the convenience of patients and obstetricians(7) .cesarean section on demand allows a woman to choose a cesarean section without a medical reason, based solely on her personal preference Five themes that reflected the reasons for elective cesarian birth without medical indication were identified: (1) fear of vaginal birth process, (2) concerns about future sexual life, (3) need for humanized birth, (4) personal reasons, and (5) decision-making process.(8) raising the awareness of providers about the appropriate indications for CS and the importance of advocating for vaginal delivery among eligible women - including those with a previous CScan trigger practice changes that may reduce the incidence of non-medically indicated caesarean delivery"

NCT06622161,Automated Versus Manual Oxygen Control in Preterm Babies on Respiratory Support,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06622161,"Babies admitted in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) frequently need supplemental oxygen to keep their oxygen saturation (SpO2) in target range (TR). Hypoxia and hyperoxia episodes should be avoided while working toward this goal. Preterm babies are particularly vulnerable to abnormal oxygen levels, and adverse effects of hyperoxia and oxygen toxicity may result in retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Similarly, mortality may rise due to hypoxic events. In routine practice, the SpO2 target is usually achieved by manual adjustment of FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen), but it usually does not accomplish the desired SpO2 target, leading to episodes of hyperoxia and hypoxia and increased risk of complications. A study was conducted in multiple centers involving extremely preterm babies, the results of which depicted that the babies on manual control of FiO2 spent only 48% of their time with SpO2 in the target range, 16% below the target range, and 36% above it. The compliance of the SpO2 target range was also variable in these centers. There is a need to improve compliance by using automated oxygen control systems.

At the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) investigators have included SLE 6000 (SLE, Croydon, UK) ventilators in their NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) which have automated oxygen control device ""Oxygenie"" that continuously adjusts FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of the patient to keep SpO2 in the target range, avoiding abnormal oxygen levels. This also reduces the workload on staff and improves patient care. Investigators usually put preterm babies on these ventilators so that SpO2 can be kept most of the time in the target range. When the OxyGenie and SpO2 monitoring are added to the SLE 6000 ventilator, it becomes possible to accurately regulate and deliver closed loop oxygen to preterm infants. This automated oxygen control system limits episodes of both hypoxia and hyperoxia by using the VDL 1.1 algorithm that uses an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm to control the FiO2 adjustments in response to changes in SpO2. This keeps SpO2 within a target range (TR) which user selects. A randomized crossover trial comparing two devices for automated oxygen control in preterm infants included the SLE 6000 ventilator as one of its devices."

NCT06621823,Image-guided Ultrasound Robotic Intraoperative Evaluation of Lymph-nodes Status in Gynecological Malignancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06621823,"The assessment of lymph node status is of crucial importance in gynaecological malignancies.

Indeed, the prognosis and adjuvant treatment regimens are strongly influenced by the presence of nodal involvement. Systematic extensive lymphadenectomies are often performed for staging, diagnosis of skip metastases and to define the radiation field when radiotherapy treatments are required. Nevertheless, these can lead to significant short-term and long-term lymphatic complications, which are difficult to justify if the lymph nodes are free from metastasis. To avoid unnecessary comprehensive procedures in early-stage cancers, evaluation of the sentinel lymph node has acquired a valuable role even if limitations are still present (rate of frozen section false negative, ""empty packets"" and mapping failure). The introduction of an intra-operative non-invasive imaging technique capable of describing the presence and characteristics of lymph nodes could help in (1) eliminating the risk of empty packet, (2) orienting the intraoperative decision while avoiding the drawbacks of frozen section (time and resources, partial destruction of the tissue material), (3) orientate the pathological section if frozen section is used. To date, technological advancements have paved the way for enhanced intra-operative assessment of cancerous organs and lesions. Over the past decade, the evolution of robotic surgery combined with advancements in image-guided surgery techniques has led to the introduction of ultrasound probes designed specifically for intraoperative ultrasound during robotic surgery (RIOUS). Apart from the conventional rigid laparoscopic probes, which can be inserted through an accessory trocar, there are robotic probes tailored to fit device arms, and drop-in flexible probes that are becoming increasingly relevant in the scientific panorama. Notably, the latter drop-in probes feature a rigid segment designed for compatibility with robotic graspers, leveraging the dexterity and rotational manoeuvrability inherent to robotic surgery. Such probes, already proven effective in evaluating liver and kidney lesions as well as tumour margins, hold promise for intraoperative lymph node assessments due to the possibility of reaching difficult anatomical spaces thanks to the robotic-assisted movements"

NCT06621459,"Retrospective Observational Study of the Safety and Toxicity Management of Abemaciclib in Combination with Adjuvant Hormone Therapy in Patients with RH+ ,HER2-nonoveramplified Breast Cancer, Real-life Data (MONARCHE29)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06621459,"Overall survival at 8 years under treatment for localized hormone-dependent breast cancer is 93.3% (1). Adjuvant therapy, especially hormone therapy, helps reduce the risk of recurrence.

However, the risk of relapse remains significant, estimated at around 20% according to studies. The SOFT study, which compares the type of hormone therapy used in premenopausal patients, estimates a relapse risk of 21.1% at 8 years (1), especially when there is initial lymph node involvement. In fact, in cases of lymph node involvement, the cumulative relapse rate at 10 years after stopping hormone therapy ranges between 19% and 36% (2), and the risk of death from breast cancer 20 years after stopping hormone therapy is estimated at 28% to 49% (2).

CDK4/6 inhibitors first demonstrated their efficacy at the metastatic stage. Abemaciclib improved median survival to 46.7 months compared to a median of 37.3 months with hormone therapy alone (Monarch 2 (3) and Monarch 3 (4)). Palbociclib showed in PALOMA-2 (5) an improvement in progression-free survival (24.8 months versus 14.5 months) without an improvement in overall survival. Ribociclib, in turn, demonstrated in MONALEESA 2 (6) an improvement in PFS (25.3 months versus 16 months) and in overall survival (63.9 months versus 51.4 months). These treatments have become the standard first-line treatment for patients with RH+ HER2 non-amplified breast cancer.

Given the results in advanced lines, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been the subject of studies in localized breast cancer, particularly in this high-risk population where the recurrence rate remains significant.

The MONARCH-E study, published on September 20, 2020 (7), led to the approval of Abemaciclib by European authorities at the time of the initial publication (median follow-up of 15.4 months) and to reimbursement starting in May 2023 after a second interim analysis (8) in this at-risk population, with a 5.6% reduction in relapse risk after 42 months of follow-up compared to hormone therapy alone.

It is crucial to clearly define the at-risk population in order to offer them treatment intensification while maintaining a satisfactory quality of life. The group benefiting from Abemaciclib presented grade III toxicity in 43% of cases and grade IV toxicity in 2.5%.

Real-world data are needed to better understand the management and toxicity of this treatment."

NCT06621368,Effect of Two Years of Resistance Training on Health Status in Postmenopausal Women: Longitudinal Study Active Aging.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06621368,"Aging is a natural process of the life cycle that can result in morphological, neuromuscular, metabolic, physiological, cognitive and behavioral changes that can compromise quality of life, autonomy, self-esteem, health and life expectancy, especially in the elderly. On the other hand, resistance training (RT) has been widely recommended for the elderly population, due to the numerous health benefits it brings, such as increased strength and muscle mass, reduced body fat, increased bone mineral content and density, and improved cardiometabolic profile, among others. However, the effectiveness of RT in attenuating or reversing the deleterious effects of aging has been analyzed by studies conducted, in most cases, over relatively short periods, i.e., eight to 24 weeks. Considering that recent investigations have demonstrated a wide variation in the adaptive responses to RT in this population, it is likely that many of these responses are time-dependent. Additionally, the influence of important mediators and moderators in this process, especially training intensity and volume, dietary habits, the presence or absence of diseases and degenerative processes that cause disability, and the use of polypharmaceuticals, has not yet been well established. Therefore, based on the Active Aging Longitudinal Study, a research project initiated in 2012, it is intend to analyze whether or not RT practice can produce positive and lasting adaptive responses on muscle strength, body composition, functional fitness, cognition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and cardiac function in postmenopausal women, based on a randomized controlled clinical trial over a long period of time (two years). In addition, mediation and moderation analyses will be used to understand the real impact of RT on the outcomes to be analyzed."

Frequent acute exacerbations are likely to be a distinct asthma phenotype. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations, but previous studies have mostly been cross-sectional studies at a single time point or prospective studies based on smaller sample sizes. Moreover, most of the studies on frequent acute exacerbations have been conducted in severe or refractory asthma, whereas a certain proportion of non-severe asthmatics may also experience frequent acute exacerbations, the risk factors of which remain to be further evaluated. The main objectives of this project are to compare the baseline clinical, inflammatory, pathophysiological, comorbidities, environmental pollutants and meteorological exposure characteristics of patients with frequent acute exacerbations and those with non-frequent acute exacerbations irrespective of asthma severity, and to develop a disease prediction model for frequent acute exacerbations; and to develop a cohort of patients with frequent acute exacerbations of asthma, observe their prognosis and response to treatment, and search for prognostic factors associated with them. The successful implementation of this study will help in the early identification of patients with frequent acute exacerbations, clarify the factors associated with poor prognosis in this group of patients, and thus provide an individualized plan for the treatment and prevention of this type of patients, which is of great significance in achieving good asthma control, reducing the burden of disease, decreasing the cost of healthcare, and saving clinical healthcare resources and costs."

Retrosygmoid (RS), key-hole retrosygmoid (KR) and cerebellar hemispheric (CH) are the most common approaches used to access in this area. Despite they are not technically difficult to perform, these approaches can be burdened by postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, both at short and long-term follow-up, with an high risk of meningitis. Many techniques were employed to avoid this risk, but it can still be estimated between 2% and 11% according to literature1-4. Spena et al. reported a CSF leakage rate of 6.8% in a previous experience5. As a consequence, newer efforts are necessaries to avoid this potentially lethal complication.

NCT06619002,Implementation of Surgical Safety and Intraoperative Metastasis Identification Through Deep Learning: Multicentric Video Collection for Minimally Invasive Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Uterine Malignancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06619002,"The loco-regional metastatic or non-metastatic status of lymph nodes (LN) is critical for the therapeutic management of most cancer patients. Indeed, the presence or absence of lymphatic metastasis is essential for the accurate staging of the disease and strongly influence the prognosis and adjuvant treatment regimens. An important revolution in oncological surgery has been the introduction of the concept of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy to reduce the complications of extensive loco-regional lymphadenectomies. SLN identification through ICG- based near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) cervical injection and its dissection is now recommended by European guidelines to stage uterine malignancies (endometrial and cervical cancers). However, SLN procedures have several limitations. In 11.2% of cases intra- or postoperative complications are reported due to anatomical structures injuries (vessels, nerves and lymphatic channels disruptions). Common mistakes, especially when the learning curve is not completed (at least 40 procedures), include mapping failure (25%) and removal of second/third-level nodes and/or empty nodes packets (8-14%). Additionally the intraoperative accuracy of frozen section is still far to be adequate with only the 65% of SLN metastasis detection.

These limitations are a result of the lack of precision of current SLN localization and analysis as well as of the overall difficulty of visualizing lymph nodes and other critical structures in the retroperitoneum.

Currently, studies on the safety of surgical procedures are based on perioperative clinical information and postoperative reports written by the surgeons themselves. Today, videos guiding minimally invasive surgical interventions allow for objective documentation of the procedure and provide opportunities to explore solutions for enhancing safety in the operating room. With an increasing use of endoscopic systems across different specialties, there is a need for standardization of training, assessment, testing and sign-off as a competent surgeon in order to improve patient safety. In laparoscopic lymph node dissection in endometrial and cervical cancer, a standardize stepwise approach to the procedure is highly recommended, by identifying key anatomic landmarks and structures, in various scenarios, that could prevent vascular, nervous and ureters injuries and enhance the mapping rate. Therefore, quantifying and studying intraoperative events such as the rate of achieving the right space dissections and anatomic structures visualization as a recommended step for safety and proficiency, would enable the examination of how best to implement guideline recommendations and seek new solutions to reduce operative risks. These videos could be utilized to train and validate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, with the potential to assist surgeons in the operating room and make the procedures safer. Additionally, the visual information (ICG intensity) could hide data that the AI can analyze and correlate with anatomopathological reports.

NCT06618833,Medical and Sociological Characterization of the Population of Patients Admitted for a First Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation in the Occitanie Ouest Region,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06618833,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with a prevalence of 1 to 4% and constitutes a major health problem both on an individual level (impaired quality of life, heart failure, stroke, hospitalization, excess mortality) and collective level (cost, use of resources).

Non-medical determinants influence health, particularly its cardiovascular component, but have been little studied in the context of Atrial fibrillation. The rare studies addressing the subject suggest that they impact the incidence of the disease and the occurrence of its complications. Certain social and sociological characteristics are also associated with less access to the various recognized therapies, whether medicinal or invasive. This is the case for Atrial fibrillation ablation, which has nevertheless demonstrated its usefulness in reducing the Atrial fibrillation burden, in reducing symptoms and hospitalizations and for certain populations (heart failure) a decrease in mortality.

Essien et al in a literature review report that non-Caucasian and low-income people have less access to Atrial fibrillation ablation. Non-Caucasian populations are also under-represented in interventional clinical studies on Atrial fibrillation. If the level of education (health literacy), geographic origin (rural vs. urban) and the level of isolation affect the occurrence of Atrial fibrillation and its natural history, including complications, the authors do not mention any specific study that has evaluated their role in access to ablation.

A Norwegian national analysis (Olsen) based on data from the health system, therefore exhaustive, evaluated the characteristics of patients suffering from Atrial fibrillation and having benefited from ablation compared to the characteristics of patients treated medically. Patients with the highest levels of education and income are the most likely to be treated by ablation. Women, especially at younger ages, have less access to ablation. The authors also found significant differences between the different territorial subdivisions of the country."
NCT06618742,Focal Cryoballoon Ablation for Malignant Dysphagia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06618742,"Rationale:

Dysphagia is commonly encountered in patients with esophageal carcinoma who are no candidates for treatment with curative intent. It often has a considerable impact on quality of life and can cause malnourishment. Current palliative treatments mainly include esophageal stenting and radiotherapy, but these can be associated with substantial drawbacks such as a high rate of adverse events, fatigue or an untimely/ temporary symptom improvement. Recent studies showed promising results for the use of spray cryotherapy as palliation for dysphagia. Moreover, there are suggestions that cryotherapy has a positive effect on the host's anti-tumor response. However, no data exists on the feasibility, efficacy and safety for cryoballoon therapy in the esophagus. Secondly, cryo-immunologic data in patients with EC is lacking.

Objective:

1. To evaluate the feasibility of cryoballoon ablation in patients with esophageal carcinoma and symptoms of dysphagia. Additionally, efficacy and safety will be assessed.
2. To evaluate the effect of cryoballoon ablation on host's anti-tumor response. Study design: Pilot study, Multi-center Prospective Uncontrolled Intervention

Study Study population: Adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with dysphagia due to incurable esophageal carcinoma Intervention (if applicable): Focal cryoballoon ablation of visible tumor during an upper endoscopy. Cryoballoon ablation will be performed for two cycles of 12 seconds. In total, patients will undergo 3 treatment sessions (range 1-3) with an interval of 1-3 weeks based onthe severity of symptoms reported by the patient.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

* - Feasibility of cryoballoon ablation defined as technical success of the procedure

  * Safety based on incidence of procedure-related serious adverse events
  * Efficacy defined as success rates two weeks after the last cryoablation treatment based on patient reported symptom improvement, and objective evaluation of the esophageal lumen that is free from tumor
* Host's anti-tumor response after cryoballoon ablation based on sequential esophageal tumor biopsies and peripheral blood samples"
NCT06618677,Efficacy of a Low FODMAP Diet in IBS Children and Impact on Urinary and Faecal Metabolome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06618677,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with defecation, or changes in stool frequency or stool form .

The low FODMAPs diet (LFD) is a relatively new approach in the management of IBS and focuses on limiting intake of poorly absorbed carbohydrates.

FODMAPs are highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols contained in a wide variety of foods. FODMAPs include oligosaccharides (fructans, fructo-oligosaccharides = FOS and galacto-oligosaccharides = GOS), disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol, polydextrose, and isomalt).

Many studies and meta-analysis in adults have shown that a low FODMAPs diet is effective in reducing IBS symptoms, particularly bloating and abdominal pain. On the other hand, evidences in children are scarce.

Previous studies in adults have demonstrated differences in urine metabolites between IBS patients receiving LFD compared to a high FODMAP diet (HFD), providing interesting hypotheses for pathophysiological mechanisms in IBS.

Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a LFD on gastrointestinal symptoms in children with IBS. Moreover, the investigators will assess the impact of LFD vs a diet with a standard content of FODMAPs (SFD) on the fecal and urinary metabolomic profile of pediatric IBS patients.

This is a single center, prospective, single blind low versus standard FODMAPs diet trial with crossover performed at Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at the University of Bari.

The trial includes four phases (run-in, low FODMAP diet, wash out and standard FODMAP diet). The run-in phase (weeks 1-2) aim to assess basal symptoms while on habitual diet and only symptomatic children (VAS\&gt;3) will progress to the dietetic intervention trial.

Then patients will be randomized to low or standard FODMAP diet for 14 days; then, children from both arms start the wash-out period of two weeks and subsequently start the final 2-week period on standard or low FODMAP diet."

NCT06618573,Safety of Administering Isoniazid to SLE Patients to Prevent TB,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06618573,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical systemic autoimmune disease characterized by heterogeneity, multisystem involvement, and production of multiple autoantibodies. Clinical features can vary, from mild skin and joint involvement to severe and life-threatening conditions.

Patients with lupus are more susceptible to infections, in addition to being immunocompromised, and due to the administration of corticosteroid and cytotoxic drugs. The presence of these infections is a cause of death in lupus disease in addition to the activity of the disease itself, especially in Asia-Pacific countries. One infection that often occurs in lupus is Tuberculosis (TB).

Efforts have been made to prevent TB infection in vulnerable populations, including isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis. In 2010, World Heatlh Organization issued guidelines for HIV patients to receive INH prophylaxis to prevent TB infection. The implementation of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) is quite cheap using INH with mild side effects.18 A meta-analysis study of INH prophylaxis in patients with HIV found that the efficacy of this prophylaxis significantly reduced TB incidence by 35% with an RR of 0.65%. In addition, INH was found to be safe, with no significant increase in drug reactions, according to a meta-analysis of prophylaxis studies in HIV patients.

However, there is no guideline for INH prophylaxis for SLE patients, as there is for HIV patients, due to lack of data on this issue.

Studies on the effectiveness of INH prophylaxis on the prevention of TB infection for SLE patients should be conducted, but before that, studies on the safety of INH therapy in SLE patients should be conducted."

NCT06618092,Relisten: Enhancing Care Quality and Saving Time With Automatic Clinical Note Generation in Primary Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06618092,"Background:

Relisten is an artificial intelligence-based software developed by Recog Analytics that improves patient care by facilitating more natural interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. Relisten extracts relevant information from recorded conversations, structuring it in the medical record and sending it to the Health Information System after the professional\&amp;amp;#39;s approval. This approach allows professionals to focus on the patient without the need to perform clinical documentation tasks.

Method:

This Proof of Concept (PoC) study is conducted as a multi-centre trial with the participation of several health professionals in Primary Care Centres (CAPs) of Amposta, Centelles, ArtÃ©s, Sallent, SÃºria and the Consorci d\&amp;amp;#39;AtenciÃ³ PrimÃ ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerra (CAPSBE). During the study, Relisten will be used in consultations under informed consent, followed by patient and professional surveys. Statistical analyses will be performed for each objective, using independent sample comparison tests according to normality evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Lilliefors correction. The sample has been determined a priori to optimise the achievement of satisfactory results. Stratified statistical tests will also be performed to consider the variance between professionals.

Discussion:

The investigators expect an improvement in the quality of care perceived by patients and a significant reduction in the time spent taking clinical notes, with a saving of at least 30 seconds per visit. Although a high quality of the notes generated is expected, it is uncertain whether a significant improvement over the control group, which is already expected to have high quality notes, will be demonstrated."

NCT06617871,Mechanical Alignment Vs Kalipered Kinematic Alignment Total Knee Arthroplasty,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06617871,"Knee replacement surgery can be performed in one of two ways. Traditionally the goal was for the new joint to be in a neutral position with respect to the femur (thigh bone). This is called Mechanical Alignment (MA). The neutral position is different than the human knee's natural position, so MA often requires the surgeon to make additional cuts to the ligaments and other soft tissue around the knee. More recently surgeons have started to place the new joint in a position that more closely replicates the natural alignment of the human knee. This is called Kinemetic Alignment (KA). KA can be done without additional soft tissue dissection but the procedure requires a higher level of precision that can be difficult to achieve in every case.

Some studies have found no difference in outcomes between MA and KA, whereas others have found KA to be superior. But these were small studies or studies that did not consider patient-rated outcomes."

Abnormal glycogen accumulation is responsible for frequent hypoglycaemia and symptoms in the liver and striated muscles (GSD-IIIa), although some patients present with liver involvement only (GSD-IIIb). In childhood, the phenotype is mainly characterised by hepatomegaly, short stature and hypoglycaemia, with minimal skeletal muscle involvement. While liver symptoms improve spontaneously around puberty, skeletal muscle weakness develops progressively in adulthood and becomes a major feature of GSD-IIIa.

Currently, there is no treatment other than dietary management tailored to the individual to limit glycogen storage and avoid hypoglycaemia.

The French GSD-III registry is a multicentre online registry dedicated to patients with type III glycogen storage disease followed in France. It has been approved by ethical and regulatory authorities. Its main inclusion criteria is the presence of a proven pathogenic AGL gene mutation and/or reduced glycogen debranching enzyme activity.

The aims of the registry are to provide a tool for recording detailed diagnostic, metabolic, neurological, cardiac and biological data on French patients with GSD-III, so as to enable i) a precise natural history of the disease, ii) identification of the outcome measures most sensitive to disease progression, iii) assessment of the frequency of the various complications of the disease and iv) identification of prognostic factors."

NCT06616363,Does a Periaqueductal Gray-vagus Nerve Interface Malfunction Explain the Nat hx With Its Numerous Co-morbidities?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06616363,"Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common and disabling disorder among adolescents. No epidemiologic data exist to support the often cited 0.5 to 2% prevalence. Case series suggest 3 to 5 times greater incidence in girls than boys. POTS is defined in children as daily chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and a 40 bpm rise in heart rate in the first 10 minutes of a tilt study in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. POTS often develops after an acute event like an illness, infection, immunization, head trauma, psychological trauma or surgery. Natural history data are absent for POTS, though some outcome studies exist. Orthostatic symptoms improve in the majority and heart rate changes improve in 38% at 1 year. A 2-year follow up showed small improvement in comorbid symptoms of POTS in a 12 subject cohort followed yearly. In a pediatric 5-year outcome follow up questionnaire study, 86% of adolescents with POTS reported resolved, improved, or intermittent, symptoms, with primarily physical rather than mental health complaints."
NCT06616337,Patients Suffering From Emotional Dysregulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06616337,"Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a common syndrome in psychiatric disorders. It is characterized by intense emotions, easily triggered, and with significant psychological impact: explosions of anger, irritability, impulsivity, emotional lability, etc. It is systematic in borderline personality disorder, and observed in a majority of patients with bipolar disorder. (even in the interictal period), adult ADHD, or addictions. ED is a cause of psychological distress, suicidal behavior or non-suicidal self-injury, and impaired quality of life. Pharmacological treatments only very partially improve these symptoms. Psychotherapies aimed at reducing ED are poorly developed in France. Dialectical behavioral therapy is a therapy that has shown its effectiveness in ED of BPD.

This is why the psychiatry and addiction center of the University Hospitals of Strasbourg has set up groups using this psychotherapeutic approach based on this technique for almost 3 years. This technique being very little practiced in France, and even less studied, we want to see if it is adapted to a French population not accustomed to this type of practice."
NCT06616285,The Effects of a Hungarian Multidomain Lifestyle Intervention on Brain Health in Older Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06616285,"Maintaining brain health in older adults is a critical social and economic challenge given the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders. Despite extensive research, effective pharmacological treatments for dementia remain limited, emphasising the need for early diagnosis and prevention of cognitive decline. Research suggests that lifestyle and modifiable factors account for approximately 40% of dementia risk, highlighting the potential of personalised lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The original FINGER study demonstrated that a multi-domain lifestyle intervention simultaneously targeting dietary habits, physical and cognitive activity, as well as social interactions can effectively prevent cognitive decline and dementia.

The HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial investigates the impact of a Hungarian lifestyle intervention on brain health in older adults and is based on the FINGER multi-domain intervention. This randomised controlled study aims to maintain and enhance neurocognitive function and prevent cognitive decline in older adults through a multi-domain lifestyle program, which simultaneously targets dietary habits, physical and cognitive activity, and social engagement.

The primary goal of the HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial is to evaluate the impact of the intervention programme on neurocognitive functions and adaptive changes in large-scale brain networks at the individual level using the precision structural and functional MRI methods as well as resting-state EEG frequency-domain analyses. In addition, the influence of the intervention will be assessed in a wide range of cognitive and personal domains. The potential relationship between brain structure and function, cognitive performance, lifestyle factors, and dementia risk factors will be evaluated.

80 people without substantial cognitive impairment or dementia will be recruited into the programme in Budapest, Hungary. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 either to the multi-domain, folk dancing lifestyle intervention group or the self-guided, multi-domain lifestyle intervention group. The self-guided intervention encompasses multi-domain lifestyle recommendations on diet, physical and mental training, and health checks. The folk dancing intervention includes structured, one-hour folk dancing sessions three times per week, which were specifically developed to foster physical and cognitive function whilst facilitating social interaction. Participants in this group will also receive intensive and tailored lifestyle recommendations aimed at improving physical and mental functioning. The duration of the intervention programme is 6 months. Participants will complete assessment visits before and after the intervention.

The HUN-MLI-BRAIN trial holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of how lifestyle interventions may impact brain function. The use of advanced, precision neuroimaging techniques will offer novel insights into the adaptive changes in brain networks and potentially lead to more effective, personalised interventions for maintaining brain health in older adults."

NCT06615388,Low Energy Availability and Cardiovascular Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06615388,"Low energy availability (LEA) signifies a condition where the body lacks sufficient energy to support essential physiological functions crucial for maintaining optimal health (1). This energy insufficiency can be exacerbated by the demands of sports and exercise, resulting in negative impacts on various physiological, psychological, and sports performance (11, 8, 2). While LEA is commonly associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, such as early atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and lower blood pressure, the existing body of research faces limitations, including small sample sizes and primarily exploratory approaches (2). Additionally, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting a strong link between DNA methylation (an epigenetic modification influencing gene expression by tagging specific parts of the DNA code) and cardiovascular disease (9, 6), there has been no prior investigation exploring the interplay between DNA methylation, cardiovascular disease, and LEA. To better understand LEA and its effects on cardiovascular health, it is imperative to address these limitations through further research. Utilising more comprehensive markers of cardiovascular disease and expanding the scope of investigations will contribute to a great understanding of LEA and its implications on cardiovascular health (10)."

NCT06615258,"The Effect of Breathing-based Pelvic Floor Muscle Training on Menstrual Symptoms, Pain and Quality of Life",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06615258,"Primary dysmenorrheic (PD) pain usually begins during adolescence, at menarche or shortly after (6-24 months), and has a clear and predictable temporal pattern. The pain typically radiates to the back and thighs and lasts for 8-72 hours. The pain is most severe on the first and/or second day of menstrual bleeding. Additionally, systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and insomnia often accompany the pain. In secondary dysmenorrhea, it can result from a range of identifiable pathological conditions, including endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Other gynecological symptoms such as intermenstrual bleeding and menorrhagia may also accompany it, depending on the underlying condition. Empirical treatment approaches have been reported as appropriate for patients with primary dysmenorrhea based on symptoms and physical examination results. Recent studies have indicated that during diaphragmatic breathing, all the muscles that make up the thoracic and abdominal walls should expand in a cylindrical manner in all directions through synchronized eccentric activity. Thus, a more effective result will occur with the concentric contraction and 360-degree expansion of the diaphragm during inspiration, which raises intra-abdominal pressure .

The follow-up program offered to stage I and low-risk stage II patients has not changed accordingly and is still focused solely on recurrence detection. Moreover, it is a one-size-fits-all program, i.e. most of the follow-up resources are spent on non-recurrence patients who do not benefit.

Up to 50% of cancer survivors suffer from reduced quality of life related to fear of cancer recurrence, treatment-related psychological distress, and/or severe late adverse effects of a biopsychosocial and/or organ-specific origin. Today many of these symptoms can be treated effectively. However, no systematic program aimed at monitoring and addressing the symptoms has been implemented yet.

The current project is testing a newly developed, digitally managed, patient-centered follow-up program that focuses on individual patient needs, including fear of cancer recurrence, psychological well-being, management of late adverse effects, and recurrence surveillance. This new program will be compared to the current standard of care in a national network of 11 colorectal cancer surgical centers in four of five Danish regions.

Patients in the intervention group will receive the following:

1. Risk-stratified circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) guided recurrence surveillance.

NCT06614452,Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Fine-needle Biopsy for Tissue Sampling of Biliary Strictures: a Multicenter Prospective Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06614452,"After the disappointing results of first-generation reverse bevel fine-needle biopsy (FNB) needles, newer 'third generation' endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) needles were developed, known as the ""end-cutting"" needles. These needle types have shown excellent diagnostic accuracy (\&gt;90%) in pancreatic masses and several other lesions, even without rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) and are not associated with increased adverse event incidence . The main design of end-cutting FNB needles are the Franseen type, which has three symmetrically distributed needle points and cutting edges, and the Fork-tip type which has 2 protruding asymmetrical sharp points and six distal cutting edges; however, other end-cutting needles are currently available such as the three-prong asymmetric tip needle and the Menghini tip needle.

Given the significant increase in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity observed in other abdominal lesions, these needles are expected to improve the diagnostic outcomes of EUS-FNB of ""pure"" biliary strictures although clinical data are still lacking.

The aim of this study is to ascertain the impact of end-cutting FNB needles in the diagnostic algorithm of biliary strictures in absence of a clear pancreatic or abdominal mass.

This is a multicenter international observational prospective study. Consecutive patients diagnosed with biliary strictures in absence of a pancreatic or abdominal mass will be assessed for eligibility.

Patients with jaundice requiring decompression, will undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with tissue sampling (brushing and/or biopsy) and biliary drainage, preferably in the same session immediately after EUS-FNB.

Endoscopic ultrasound will be performed using a curvilinear array echoendoscope. FNB with 22G or 25G end-cutting needles will be performed. The size of the needles will be based on the personal choice of the endoscopist. Likewise, the sampling technique, whether using the ""slow-pull"", the ""dry suction"", or the ""wet suction"", will be based on the physician's choice. Three passes will be performed as per current guidelines. Specimens will be collected in 3 vials to allow for analysis according to needle pass; one for the first pass, one for the second pass, and one for the third and any eventual subsequent passes.

The ROSE will not be available in this study. Primary outcome will be diagnostic sensitivity of EUS-FNB and 45 patients will be prospectically enrolled."

NCT06613555,Retinal Microvascularization in OCT-angiography and Systemic Diseases,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06613555,"Systemic diseases are inflammatory, chronic illnesses affecting different organs and altering their function. At present, there are few non-invasive methods for predicting their onset and progression.

Some chronic diseases can be anticipated earlier thanks to predictive indicators. These indicators could help doctors decide which treatment is best suited to each patient. In particular, the state of microcirculation in the eyes, specifically in the retina, is linked to the progression of certain diseases in the body. Unfortunately, assessing the health of the small blood vessels in the retina is complicated. Most current methods are imprecise, difficult to reproduce and require qualified specialists. However, the use of retinal microcirculation appears to be a promising approach to solving these problems.

In fact, the structure of retinal blood vessels can be observed easily, painlessly and without invasive procedures, thanks to fundus photographs or scans providing imaging slices known as optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A).

The vascularization of the retina is very often presented as a window giving access to the peripheral vascularization (the vascularization of other organs distant from the eyes).

For example, we recently demonstrated a link between retinal vascularization and the risk of heart problems in patients with coronary artery disease.

The aim of this study is to gather original information on the evolution of retinal vascularization, using specific markers that may be associated with damage to distant organs.

By regularly monitoring these changes over time, the researchers hope to identify early changes that could indicate the development or evolution of these diseases.

The main aim of this study is to create a database of images obtained by OCT-Angiography in patients with systemic diseases and in healthy individuals. This will enable us to identify early changes in retinal vascularization that may be associated with these systemic pathologies.

With this information, we hope to improve early diagnosis and monitoring of diseases, which could have a positive impact on patients\&#39; health."

NCT06613451,The Effect of Mobile Application Use on Drug Administration Knowledge and Skill Level of Pediatric Nursing Students,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06613451,"Care forms the basis of the nursing profession. Nurses have many roles, duties and responsibilities in the care process. One of these roles is safe drug practices within the scope of its therapeutic/healing role. Safe medication practices are an important component of patient safety, which is one of the most important indicators of quality in health care services. The pediatric patient group is a group at risk for medication errors. The reasons for this situation include the developmental characteristics of the pediatric group, their anatomical differences, their bioavailability, pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacodynamic properties compared to adults, the lack of ready-made forms of pediatric dose drugs, the excess of nurses' care practices in pediatric children, the limited communication ability of the pediatric patient, lack of personnel, medication for the pediatric group. There are deficiencies in application knowledge and skills. Medication errors can lead to fatal situations for children. There are a number of improvements made to prevent this situation. Despite all the improvements, it is seen that nurses continue to experience difficulties in drug preparation and administration, and medication administration is still a significant problem. One of the most important steps in solving this problem is the training on drug administration to be given during undergraduate education. Considering the learning skills and preferences of undergraduate nursing students living in adolescence, it is seen that they have a predisposition to technology, their ability to use it in daily life, and their interests. For this reason, it seems that technology-based applications can be used to help students learn medication practices more willingly, permanently and effectively. Technology and mobile applications; It is a learning method that affects all tactile, visual and kinesthetic areas. Use of technology in education; It develops independent learning skills, increases active learning, and offers different types of learning strategies together.

The evaluation will be conducted using a combination of clinical scales and objective motion sensors that map walking quality and performance during activities of daily living, such as rising from a chair and standing.

It is acknowledged that this single-group pilot study, which aims to include 12 participants, is insufficiently powered to address the primary objective. A larger parallel-design study is required to definitively address this issue. To help design a larger study, the current objectives are: first, to have realistic expectations regarding recruitment and dropout rates; second, to identify potential barriers to therapy adherence and data collection that may impede the success of a larger study; third, assess the test-retest reliability of sensor-based motion capture of movement quality during walking and related tasks in hemiparetic stroke patients. For the latter objective, the sensor measurements at the end of the intervention will be repeated on two consecutive days.

In addition to their usual care, participants will undergo additional therapy over a four-week period, with sessions occurring five times per week for one hour as part of the BOOST GAIT program. The BOOST GAIT sessions will be conducted as group-based therapy with four patients and two physiotherapists present to oversee the performance of mobility-specific exercises, including sit-to-stand transfers, standing and stepping, and eventually walking. The rationale for this approach is that the combined effects of augmenting the amount of therapeutic exercises and specifically targeting motor control of the paretic leg will facilitate symmetry during tasks, which in turn will have carry-over effects on safe performance of walking and other mobility tasks."

NCT06612333,Evaluation of the French Version of the PEERS Social Skills Training Program for Adolescents With Rare Neurodevelopmental Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06612333,"Adolescents and young adults with rare neurodevelopmental disorders are at risk of developing psychiatric pathologies during the transition to adulthood. Loneliness and lack of social relationships can lead to anxiety and depression in adolescents and young adults with rare neurodevelopmental disorders. Anxiety and depression are major risk factors for the transition to psychiatric symptoms in adulthood. The improvement of social skills and the positive evolution of social relationships in adolescents and young adults with rare neurodevelopmental disorders can lead to a reduction in the risk factors for anxiety and depression. It therefore seems essential to evaluate the evolution of social skills in this population of young adults under the care of the social skills program, PEERS, in France to assess the overall benefit of the program, particularly in this population of young people with rare neurodevelopmental disorders."
NCT06612294,Asthma Symptom Perception Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06612294,"Asthma affects 8% of the United States population ages \>60 years and causes considerable harm: older adults are 4 times more likely to die from asthma and have twice the risk of hospitalization. The burden of asthma is notably greater among minoritized older adults. Research suggests that perception of expiratory airflow limitation may be a major determinant of asthma outcomes in older adults, and that older adults are substantially less aware of airway obstruction than younger adults. These observations suggest that perception of airflow limitation is a potential target for improving outcomes of older patients with asthma. The research team completed a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention that trains older adults with asthma to better perceive expiratory airway obstruction through feedback via peak expiratory flow (PEF) prediction and couples this feedback with motivational interviewing (MI) to promote change in asthma self-management behaviors. Compared to an attention control, the intervention improved PEF, perception of airflow limitation and asthma control. In this project, the research team will conduct a fully powered RCT to test the intervention's efficacy among 300 adults ages â‰¥60 years with uncontrolled asthma who are on controller medications (daily maintenance or as needed) recruited from underserved inner-city medical practices in New York City. Patients will be randomized to the intervention or a time and attention matched educational control. The intervention and control will be delivered in 3 sessions over 6 weeks. The study will test the impact of the intervention on perception of expiratory airflow limitation in older adults with asthma, examine the efficacy of the intervention for improvements in lung function (PEF), self-reported asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire \[ACQ\] scores), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire \[AQLQ\] scores), and emergency department and hospital use, and test the intervention's impact on mean daily ICS dose used (daily maintenance and as needed). Data will be collected at baseline, 1-month, 6-months (primary analyses of effectiveness) and 12-months post-intervention. In secondary analyses, the research team will test the sustainability of treatment effects with vs. without the booster treatment session (active booster vs. attention control booster) delivered immediately after the 6-month assessment on outcomes at 12-months."

NCT06611592,Safety and Efficacy of Pramipexole Treatment in Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06611592,"The most common and effective treatment for OCD is pharmacological therapy that includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants and, in the case of patients resistant to this approach, a combination with antipsychotics. Risperidone and aripiprazole are atypical antipsychotics that act on dopamine (D2) and serotonin receptors. Studies have shown that these drugs are effective in boosting SSRIs for the treatment of OCD in resistant patients.

Currently a high percentage of people diagnosed with OCD do not respond to the existing treatments. Pramipexole is a dopaminergic receptor agonist that specifically binds to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, having demonstrated benefit in resistant depression.

The aim of this clinical trial is to explore how pramipexole can act in the treatment of OCD in resistant patients, evaluating its safety and efficacy."

HPV is a common virus which usually causes infections that last only a few months, but sometimes can last longer. It is known to cause a variety of cancers including cancer of the cervix. Even though there are ways to detect cervical cancer early, many individuals do not undergo screening that involves pelvic exams. Over half of all new cervical cancer cases are among those who have either never been screened or who are not screened enough. Without appropriate screening and care, preventable pre-cancers may turn into cancer. A new way to detect cervical cancer is to have individuals collect their own vaginal sample for HPV testing to know their risk for cervical cancer. This may give individuals more flexibility and comfort having the ability to collect samples themselves, compared to a doctor performing a speculum examination and collecting the samples in a clinic. This study compares clinical accuracy of HPV testing on self-collected vaginal samples versus cervical samples collected by clinician.

NCT06610851,Monitoring of Patients With Low-grade Gliomas Using Circulating miRNA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06610851,"With around 3,400 cases per year in France, diffuse gliomas are the most common primary tumours of the central nervous system. Their grade varies from 2 to 4. Whatever the grade, their prognosis is poor, because tumour recurrence is systematic, because no personalised medicine is available for the treatment of these cancers, and because the tools for monitoring recurrence are imperfect. Treatment of diffuse gliomas is based on removal of as much of the tumour as possible, whatever its grade. Surgery is followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on the grade and quality of the excision. In the event of recurrence, the patient may be offered second-line chemotherapy or further surgery. During and after treatment, patients are regularly monitored by MRI in order to detect any recurrence as early as possible and propose a new treatment. However, for grade 2 and 3 gliomas, MRI monitoring is imperfect because it cannot detect tumour recurrence at an early stage. Initiation of new treatment at the time of recurrence, which is inevitable, is therefore often delayed, which is harmful for patients.

It is therefore vital to identify a reliable, easy-to-use and non-invasive biomarker that can be used to monitor patients undergoing surgery for grade 2 and 3 diffuse gliomas, and thus enable earlier diagnosis of recurrence. These biomarkers could be microRNAs.

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of genes and, consequently, of the intracellular signalling pathways that govern cell behaviour. They are therefore widely implicated in oncogenesis, and in particular in the mechanisms that promote tumour migration, invasion and proliferation.

Several preliminary studies have shown that serum levels of pro-oncogenic microRNAs correlate with tumour rates in gliomas. No study has investigated the possibility of using them to detect tumour recurrence earlier in grade 2 and 3 gliomas.

With this study, the investigators hope to use pro-oncogenic microRNAs to monitor glioma patients and diagnose early recurrence in grade 2 and 3 gliomas."

NCT06610578,ICAS Screen and Stroke Risk Prediction Based on FIF,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06610578,"Intracranial atherosclerosis stenosis (ICAS) is a leading cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and increase the global burden of stroke, especially in the Asian population. Compared with the other stroke subtypes, patients with ICAS had more severe stroke, stayed longer in the hospital and higher risk of recurrent ischemic events. Thus, early screening and effective intervention for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis can improve the level of early warning and prevention of stroke, decrease the incidence and mortality of stroke, which is of vital significance. Although digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have a high diagnostic value for ICAS, it is invasive and not available for mass population screening due to expertise, expensive cost, and poor economic performance. Potential screening tools such as transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) are promising but limited by temporal bone window quality and highly depends on operators' experience. Therefore, it is imperative to explore a novel, non-invasive, economic and complementary screening method for identifying the subjects with ICAS in mass populations such as primary health-care institutions and physical examination centers.

The retina develops from the diencephalon, shares the same embryological origin, anatomic features and physiological properties with brain, including blood supply via the internal carotid artery. A prospective cohort study has confirmed that retinal vascular signs (enhanced arteriolar light reflex) are related to intracranial large artery disease8. Rhee et al' study have also showed that retinal diameter variation is associated with ICAS9. Hence, these findings hint retinal vascular signs may be a biomarker for ICAS. Besides, the traditional vascular risk factors, such as older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and others, are also tightly associated with ICAS. However, few studies have reported the discrimination performance of retinal vascular signs itself or combining with the traditional vascular risk factors in identifying ICAS. Fundus photography has great advantages including non-invasive, easy to popularize, inexpensive and possess good economic benefits, particularly in the age of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning algorithm has widely applied to accurate varieties of retinal diseases detection and classification such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.

NCT06609980,Restoration of Antibiotics Related Infant Microbiota Perturbations by Autologous Fecal Transplant,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609980,"Antibiotics are lifesaving therapeutic drugs which have been used by adults, children, and infants alike for decades. There is an increase in global use of antibiotics over the course of lifetime and earlier in lifetime, with some countries recording as high as 12 courses a year in children younger than two. While antibiotics are successful in eradicating many pathogenic bacteria, research has demonstrated significant effect on beneficial gut microbiota, including long-lasting shift in the dynamics, composition, richness, and maturity of the intestinal flora. Microbiota alterations during early life, including through antibiotics use as well as birth via C-section, constitute a developmental perturbation, which increases the risk of modern diseases of immune and metabolic dysfunction. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests associations between early stressors of the microbiota and a number of common diseases, such as obesity, asthma, allergies, celiac disease, and Type 1 Diabetes. Furthermore, excess antibiotic exposure is associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Currently, no strategies exist to restore the microbiome other than reliance on spontaneous repair mechanism, which often takes months in a healthy individual barring further antibiotic exposure. Contrary to popular belief, ingestion of probiotics, particularly after antibiotics, has been demonstrated to slow down the repair as it introduces an exogenous and massive amounts of only a few types of bacterial strains into a finely-tuned ecosystem of hundreds of different strains.

It is hypothesized that by preserving the child's microbiome prior to antibiotic therapy and reintroducing it afterwards through an autologous fecal matter transplant (FMT) will assist in a quick, effective, and host-specific microbiome recolonization to the levels and patterns to those prior to antibiotics. This would in turn reduce the overall loss of microbiome diversity over the child's lifespan, essentially providing a 'reset' option to the child's most unadulterated version of microbiome. This approach utilizes delivering the sample by mixing it in maternal milk or formula and feeding it to the child through a bottle, which can be performed anywhere without any discomfort for the child."

NCT06609772,The Effect of Individualised Pain Education on Chronic Postoperative Pain Development and Quality of Life in Living Liver Donors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609772,"Chronic postoperative pain is defined as pain that is a continuation of acute pain or develops after a pain-free period, is localised to the surgical site, affects quality of life, and persists for at least 3 months after surgery when other pain factors are excluded. Chronic postoperative pain, as a major complication of surgery, increases the use of analgesics, restricts activities of daily living, reduces quality of life and creates a serious economic burden. Prolonged pain in the preoperative period and poorly treated postoperative acute pain may trigger the development of chronic pain. Chronic postoperative pain is an important and current problem in living liver transplant donors as in many patient groups.

Chronic pain due to severe postoperative acute pain is reported as an expected outcome after open surgical resection in living liver transplant donors. The reason for this is thought to be inadequate perioperative pain management. Inadequate perioperative pain management may lead to sub-optimal pain management, delayed recovery, unexpected readmissions, decreased patient satisfaction, prolonged duration of opioid analgesia with potential for narcotic abuse, and clinical, psychological and socioeconomic consequences that may possibly lead to chronic postoperative pain. Chronic postoperative pain is a common but overlooked complication of surgery that can cause functional limitation, psychological distress and poor quality of life in patients and its management is very important for nurses. An important aim of nursing care is to help liver living donors regain their health and quality of life. Providing management of acute postoperative pain, preventing the development of chronic postoperative pain and improving quality of life in patients undergoing surgical procedures are important issues for nurses. At the same time, chronic postoperative pain management, as a very current issue, requires nurses to plan and implement more effective interventions. With appropriate pain interventions in the preoperative and early postoperative period, the patient should be educated and counselled about self-management strategies, return to normal functionality and the possibility of developing chronic pain after surgery. Adequate perioperative education about the surgery and expected outcomes may alleviate stress, reduce the severity of acute pain and help prevent chronic postoperative pain.

It is thought that individualised pain education will be effective on chronic postoperative pain development and quality of life of patients. When the literature was reviewed, no study on individualised pain education for liver living donors was found. At the same time, no study was found in the literature in which chronic postoperative pain and quality of life were examined together in liver living donors. The fact that the subject will be investigated for the first time adds originality to the study.

With this study, the effect of individualised pain education on prevention or reduction of chronic postoperative pain and improvement of quality of life will be determined. Thus, the data obtained can be evaluated holistically and can form the basis for new and large-scale studies in the related field. At the same time, in this prospective study, the rates and characteristics of chronic postoperative pain development in liver living donors at the 3rd month after transplantation will be evaluated. Thus, this study will contribute to the limited literature on this subject.

Research Hypotheses:

H0a: Individualized pain education applied to living liver donors is not effective on the development of chronic postoperative pain.

H1a: Individualized pain education applied to living liver donors is effective on the development of chronic postoperative pain.

H0b: Individualized pain education applied to living liver donors is not effective on the quality of life of patients.

H1b: Individualized pain education applied to living liver donors is effective on the quality of life of patients."

NCT06609447,The Efficacy and Safety of Combining Probiotic VSL#3 With Vedolizumab for the Treatment of Moderate Ulcerative Colitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609447,"An imbalance in the gut microbiota and mucosal immune dysfunction leading to intestinal inflammation are central to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Both international and domestic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) guidelines consistently recommend the use of the probiotic VSL#3 for inducing or maintaining remission in cases of mild-to-moderate UC. While the development of biologic therapies in recent years has provided new directions for IBD treatment, classic biologics such as infliximab may increase the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies. Vedolizumab, when used for the induction therapy of UC, has a response rate of less than 80%, a slightly slower onset of action, and a slight increase in Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) incidence. Currently, there is a lack of clinical data on the adjunctive use of VSL#3 with biologic agents in the treatment of UC globally.

Therefore, this project aims to design a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The primary objective is to compare the changes in clinical response in patients with moderately active UC treated with either VSL#3 or placebo in combination with vedolizumab (VDZ) for six weeks."

NCT06609122,Impact of AAI Dogs on Performance and Behavior of Children with Autism,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609122,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder usually diagnosed in early childhood. Children with ASD exhibit social communication and interaction problems, which may cause deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, problems with developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, and abnormal nonverbal communicative behaviors such as impaired eye contact and body language. Some children with ASD have severe behavioral problems, such as stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, and extreme distress at small changes. ASD is a complex and individualized disorder, which creates challenges in treatment.

Animal-assisted education (AAE) programmes have been introduced for children with special needs in other countries such as the United States and Australia. PAALS (Palmetto Animal Assisted Life Services) in the United States have introduced the Pet a PAALS Dog programme, which assists stressed students at USC (University of South Carolina). Assistance Dogs Australia has provided an Educational Support Dog Echo to Kalinda Support School, for children with a wide range of disabilities. Existing literature indicate the benefit of animal-assisted therapy on physical, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities, especially in social and communication disorders. Formally trained human-dog teams in animal-assisted interventions (AAI) can play a unique role in social and communicative development that schools, and caregivers may not be able to provide. Interacting with animal-assisted intervention dogs can increase children with ASD\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s social interaction, communication, and effective connection. Dogs can also provide emotional support in stressful situations such as calming the child down when they have a tantrum. Moreover, animal-assisted therapy has shown to decrease stress levels, anxiety, and restrictive and repetitive behavior patterns. Dogs as pets can also bring significant improvements to caregivers of children with ASD and improve conflict management.

Based on a successful pilot trial in 2019 with 8 children showed that AAI program has a positive effect on the performance of children with ASD, The investigator proposed an observational study that tracks the effectiveness of an animal-assisted intervention programme in a local school for children with ASD and developmental disabilities."

NCT06609057,Cooking for Your Health in Southern New Mexico,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609057,"This clinical trial evaluates a nutritional intervention called Cocinar Para Su Salud en Paso del Norte (Cook for Your Health in Paso del Norte) for improving diet quality and knowledge related to nutrition and cancer prevention among individuals living in the El Paso del Norte region of New Mexico. New Mexico border communities have high rates of cancer and obesity, both exacerbated by poor diet quality. Traditional Mexican diets are high in fruit, vegetables, and fiber, but are intensive to prepare and not practical for many families living in New Mexico now. Vegetable oils, such as canola, safflower, and sunflower oils, are commonly used in cooking within the regional New Mexican community because they are inexpensive and readily available; however, they may not be as healthy as other options. Interventions focused on teaching proper cooking techniques and raising awareness about nutritious foods have shown positive behavior changes, including greater preference for healthier foods, increased confidence in food preparation and cooking a balanced meal, and higher vegetable variety and availability in the home. This study may help identify effective and culturally relevant real-world strategies to improve knowledge, skills, behaviors, and access to resources to improve nutrient intake, with the long-term goal of decreasing cancer risk and chronic disease risk in southern New Mexican communities."

NCT06608888,Unveiling the Neural Mechanisms of 5-HT7 in Sleep Apnea Induced by Arousal Dysregulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608888,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recognized as a highly prevalent sleep breathing disorder with severe complications, features a complex etiology. Poor understanding of disease pathogenesis limits the overall efficacy of interventions. Studies have found that upregulation of 5-HT7 expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) could reduce arousal threshold (ArTH) and induce an inhibitory effect to the respiratory central, which was associated with hypoxic stimulation. Therefore, the investigators speculate that the structural/functional abnormalities of the arousal-respiratory neural circuit, mediated by LH5-HT7, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA. To verify the hypothesis, the investigators will compare the ArTH and the brain network presenting by multimodal MRI in normal individuals, snoring individuals, and OSA patients, to reveal the correlation between arousal dysregulation and the structure/function of LH regions; compare the changes of ArTH and brain network in OSA patients with low ArTH before and after CPAP treatment, to verify the interaction between hypoxia and arousal dysregulation, as well as whether the damaging performance of the arousal-respiratory brain regulation area in OSA patients can be partially reversed by relieving hypoxia. Above all, the joint application B team will further analyze the LH5-HT7 neural mechanism in the pathogenesis of OSA."
NCT06608875,Precision Sensorimotor Neurorehabilitation Through Personalized Stimulation Loops,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608875,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects about 1% of the elderly population and accounts for substantial disability and health care costs.

Disability is largely driven by mobility deficits caused by impaired gait. Effective treatments are available to restore lower limb function and improve gait, but response to treatment varies greatly from patient to patient and often shows only small effect sizes. Addressing this heterogeneity requires personalization, a concept referred to precision neurorehabilitation.

StimuLOOP.PD intends to foster structured and reproducible methods for precision neurorehabilitation of gait in PD. The investigator will conduct a proof-of-concept study to investigate a combination of two methods that are each tailored to the individual patient. Two innovative technologies are applied in concert to enhance recovery of lower limb function.

1. Hyper-personalized feedback (HPF): For lower limb motor rehabilitation, the investigator will employ real-time continuous feedback for movement aspects that are specific to each participant's motor deficit. The feedback will be adapted and tailored to each participant. This results in a two-step personalization; in a first step, the investigator will choose what movement aspect is therapeutically targeted, and in a second step, the investigator will define how the feedback is presented to the participant.
2. Targeted auditory stimulation during sleep (TASS):The investigator aim to reactivate rehabilitation- related memories through the presentation of auditory stimuli during sleep with the goal of promoting motor memory consolidation into stable motor commands.

The HPF intervention is expected to induce rapid adaptations, which however do not persist over multiple days. To counter this, the investigator will leverage memory reactivation during sleep to enhance the consolidation of the movement patterns that are learned during HPF.

The investigator expect that these interventions will lead to greater gains in functional walking ability. Beyond demonstrating a proof-of-concept for novel methods of precision neurorehabilitation, positive results of this project may have implications for neurorehabilitation treatment in general by providing first insights into the benefits and interplay of HPF and TASS."

NCT06608628,The Effect of Patient Safety Escape Room on Nursing Students' Knowledge Level and Team Collaboration,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608628,"The concept of patient safety first emerged more than two decades ago in research by practitioners applying different approaches to improve care in the areas they work in. The main goal in patient safety is to prevent mistakes while providing service, to protect patients from possible harm and to minimize the possibility of making mistakes. For this reason, patient safety is one of the indispensable parts of nursing education. The planned research will be carried out in order to increase the patient safety escape room design and the current knowledge level of student nurses and team cooperation on this subject. The research will be carried out with the first year students of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing Department of a state university, in an experimental design with pre-test and post-test. The data of the research will be collected with the ""General Information Questionnaire"", ""Patient Safety Knowledge Test"", ""Collaboration Scale"" and ""Gamy Experience for Gamification Scale"". It is planned to carry out the study with 60 students. Control Group=30, Experiment Group=30. After the subject of patient safety is explained in the Nursing Fundamentals course, the students who agree to participate in the study will be randomly divided into experimental and control groups.

Patient safety practices will be explained to the control and experimental group students with the demonstration method in the laboratory environment after the lesson. Experimental group students will be taken to patient safety escape rooms prepared by the researcher. Students will be taken to escape rooms in groups of 5 and will be expected to perform the targeted tasks. After the lab and escape room activity, students will fill in the knowledge test and scales again. Since there is a limited number of studies in the literature on the knowledge levels of nursing students on patient safety and team collaboration, and there is no study in which escape room design is used in the field of nursing in Turkey, the research is important in terms of filling this gap in the literature."
NCT06608589,CONSTELLATIONS Living Lab: Improving the Care Transitions of Older Adults Living With Neurocognitive Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608589,"The prevalence of major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs), particularly Alzheimer's disease, among older adults is increasing. These individuals and their caregivers often face challenges due to inefficient and poorly coordinated care transitions, negatively impacting patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and the healthcare system itself. To address this, the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services has released Phase 3 of its Ministerial Guidance on Major Neurocognitive Disorders, aiming to enhance care coordination between primary healthcare professionals and those living with MNCDs and their caregivers.

Quebec's healthcare system comprises various organizations providing care and services to individuals with MNCDs. Each organization faces unique challenges hindering improvement initiatives. However, common obstacles persist: inadequate communication systems for sharing vital information, lack of access to data for measuring care transition quality, and the absence of patient/caregiver satisfaction assessments to inform service enhancements. Additionally, organizations require support in managing change.

This need for improvement, coupled with the aspiration for a patient-centered learning health system (LHS), motivated the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et services sociaux (INESSS), the Centre intÃ©grÃ© de santÃ© et de services sociaux de ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches (CISSS CA), and the research team to collaborate on adapting a proven continuous improvement program: the CoMPAS+ MNCD Program.

The Program will involve reflecting on best practices and identifying local challenges within participating Family Medicine Groups (FMGs) to propose and implement solutions. The CONSTELLATIONS Living Lab project has been tasked with co-developing, implementing, and evaluating the Program's impact on care transitions over two years. These findings will inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the Program's adaptability to the ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches region, guiding local and provincial decision-makers on healthcare system improvements and emphasizing the importance of supporting an LHS."
NCT06608563,The Effect of an Adhesive System on the Retention and Caries Prevention for Fissure Sealants in Permanent Molars,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608563,"Background: Resin-based fissure sealants (FS) are recommended to prevent pit-and-fissure caries development or prevent the progression of enamel caries lesion to frank cavitation into dentine. There is still limited clinical evidence on the use of adhesive system beneath fissure sealants in permanent molars and its effect on FS retention and caries progression.

Aim: The aim of this randomised clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of fissure sealants placed with and without prior use of an adhesive system in terms of retention and caries prevention in permanent molars over the period of 2 years.

Study design: Children (6-12 years of age) with high caries risk that require sealants in their first permanent molars (ICDAS 0-3) will be selected at the Dublin Dental University Hospital (DDUH). Molars will be stratified according to presence of caries lesions (ICDAS 0 or ICDAS1-3) and randomly allocated according to the study groups (Test group: 17% phosphoric acid + adhesive system + FS; Control group: 17% phosphoric acid + FS). The randomisation unit will be the tooth and more than one tooth can be included per child (sample size=308 teeth). All children will be evaluated after 12 and 24 months by calibrated independent examiners. The primary outcome of the present trial is caries prevention (dentine caries free surfaces) after 2 years of follow-up. The secondary outcome is sealant retention over time. Clinical variables such as age, gender, tooth position (upper/lower), caries experience (DMFT/dmft), stage of eruption (erupted/partially erupted) and children's behavior (Frankl scale) will be collected. The proportion caries free surfaces at 24 months will be evaluated using Logistic Regression analysis. Sealant retention over time will be compared using log-rank test and Kaplan Meier survival analysis. Cox regression analysis with shared frailty will be used to evaluate association with independent variables (Î±=5%)."

NCT06608381,Comparison Partial Versus Total Omentectomy in Minimal Invasive Distal Gastrectomy for cT3/4a Gastric Cancer (KLASS-10),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06608381,"For advanced gastric cancer, surgical resection is the only curable therapeutic strategy. According to minimally invasive approach is adopted in various field of oncologic surgery, laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is becoming a standard not only for early gastric cancer but also for advanced gastric cancer.

The greater omentum is an organ is known to play a role in removing bacteria in the abdominal cavity as a primary defense. Complete resection of the greater omentum has been considered essential to ensure the elimination of micrometastasis during surgery for advanced gastric cancer. However, the oncological effect of total omentectomy is still lack of evidence. Especially in minimal invasive gastrectomy, total omentectomy procedure is known to increases the operating time, increase the risk of bleeding, colonic injury, and postoperative complications such as intra-abdominal abscess, ascites, anastomotic leakage, ileus and wound infections. Therefore, in the case of minimal invasive surgery in early gastric cancer, omentectomy is omitted usually or routinely. Partial omentectomy preserves the omentum more than 3cm away from the gastro-epiploic vessels. Advanced energy devices facilitate partial omentectomy during laparoscopic gastrectomy.

According to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines, partial omentectomy (omentum preservation) is feasible for T1 or T2 tumors, and total omentectomy is recommended for clinical T3 or deeper tumors. However, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) guideline suggests total omentectomy and the European Society for Medical Oncology(ESMO) guideline does not mentioned about it.

It is still controversial whether total omentectomy should be performed in advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, we aimed to verify the non-inferiority of partial omentectomy, oncologic safety compared with total omentectomy via multicenter randomized clinical trial."

Post-operative complications of hysterectomy are numerous and their causes are poorly understood.

Indocyanine green is a fluorescent dye that, when exposed to infrared light, makes it possible to visualize the vascularization by fluorescence.

The project consists in studying the vascularization of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy using the injection of indocyanine green. This is a prospective feasibility study.

During the procedure, after performing the hysterectomy, indocyanine green will be injected intravenously into the patient. A fluorescence video of the vaginal cuff will be recorded. The fluorescence of the recorded images will be analyzed by fluorescence analysis software to obtain an objective value of fluorescence. The fluorescence values will be compared to the occurrence or absence of postoperative complications.

This is the first study using this imaging technique combined with indocyanine green in this surgery. This study will employ a novel objective sequential fluorescence analysis software that has already proven its effectiveness in digestive surgery. The sequential measurement of the change in fluorescence intensity visualized in the images of laparoscopy will enable the production of vaginal perfusion graphs using a video modeling tool such as the TRACKER software. This software measures the evolution of green levels in a region of interest, from which a time-fluorescence curve can be obtained.

NCT06607497,Better Risk Perception Via Patient Similarity to Control Hyperglycemia and Sustained by Telemonitoring,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06607497,"Background: Diabetes significantly raises the likelihood of complications, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes-related mortality, particularly due to vascular complications. It is vital to address this rising trend of mortality, by enhancing awareness of diabetes complications to improve risk perception and ultimately reduce mortality rates. Managing diabetes effectively requires interventions addressing both risk communication and monitoring, helping patients better understand and make informed decisions about their health.

Objectives: The primary aim is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of combined risk communication session using an AI module (PERDICT.AI) and home-based diabetes monitoring (PTEC-DM) versus a standalone risk communication session in improving health outcomes (risk perception, medication adherence, self-care activities and glycaemic control) among poorly controlled diabetes patients. Secondary aims are to explore participants' views and experiences of risk communication session using PERDICT.AI, PTEC-DM and usual care and clinician' views on utility of the new approach to improve risk perception.

Methods: A mixed-method study design will be employed to conduct a multi-arm randomized controlled trial across four of the SingHealth Polyclinics cluster (Pasir Ris, Eunos, Sengkang, Tampines North). Patient participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three arms. Arm 1 will receive risk communication session using PERDICT.AI and home-based diabetes monitoring using PTEC-DM alongside usual care. Arm 2 participants will undergo a standalone risk communication session using PERDICT.AI with usual care while arm 3 will serve as the control group with usual care. A total of 360 (120 in each group) participants will be enrolled by simple randomization. Eligible patient must be of age between 36 and 65 years with HbA1c \>8.0% within the last 6 months.

Significance of the study: Findings from the study may add evidence to the scientific knowledge of using these approaches to improve risk perception and recommend development of similar interventions."
NCT06607471,"Multimodal and Multidisciplinary Approach to Optimize Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Management of Patients with Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathies and Arrhythmogenic-inflammatory Phenotypes: a Multicenter, Observational, Retrospective and Prospective Registry Study.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06607471,"Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM) represent a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by absence of obstructive disease of the epicardial coronary vessels and distinct structural and functional changes of the myocardium. The main identified forms include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy proper (ACM). More recently, further forms of cardiomyopathy have been described, less common and not uniquely classifiable, including: uncompressed myocardium (LVNC), peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), structural correlates of arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse (AMVP), Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), NICM associated with multi- system neuromuscular or autoimmune diseases, lysosomal diseases, glycogenosis, mitochondrial cytopathies and canal diseases with structural substrates. Finally, there are ""overlap"" forms, characterized by the sharing in the same subject of characteristic aspects of two or more of the above- mentioned diseases; and of the ""undefined"" forms, which to date do not reach the diagnostic criteria for any of the above-mentioned diseases.

To the best of current knowledge, there are two points discovered in scientific research, namely the description of the arrhythmogenic and ""inflammatory"" phenotypes in a broad sense, which are summarized here with the acronym AINICM. In detail:

1. Arrhythmic manifestations account for the arrhythmogenic component of AINICM, which is not limited to ACM proper. In fact, most of the above diseases have a non-arrhythmic clinical presentation and a prevailing tendency to evolve towards a picture of cardiovascular decompensation. Although sudden arrhythmic death has been described throughout the spectrum of AINICM, early arrhythmic manifestations of such diseases have an unknown prevalence, an uncertain association with different disease genotypes and phenotypes, and still uncertain predictivity of long-term arrhythmic risk. At the same time, optimal diagnostic and therapeutic pathways in arrhythmias associated with AINICM are still being studied.
2. Myocardial inflammation (M-Infl) accounts for the inflammatory component of AINICM, and has recently been described in association with many AINICM on a genetic basis, including undefined and arrhythmic forms. The data is of high interest not only in the diagnostic, but also in prognostic and therapeutic field. In fact, on the one hand the presence of M-Infl seems to have a physio- pathological role in AINICM; on the other, as already known in myocarditis, the optimal therapeutic paths of arrhythmias may differ in patients with and without M-Infl; in particular, also in the light of the preliminary data available in adult and paediatric AINICM, the inflammatory forms are expected to respond better to immunosuppressive therapy, the arrhythmogenic ones to an ablative therapy with frequent need of implantation of cardiac devices.

Based on the clinical presentation, NICM patients will be divided into arrhythmic (AINICM) and non-arrhythmic patients as study and control groups , respectively. The AINICM group will include presentation with ventricular fibrillation (VF), either sustained or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT; NSVT), frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVC), supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) and bradyarrhythmias (BA). Clinical presentations other than arrhythmic, including chest pain and heart failure, will define the control group. In parallel, as shown in Figure 1, patients with any evidence of M-Infl will be compared with those showing no signs of M-Infl."

NCT06605729,"Exploring Physiotherapist's Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs and Clinical Decision-making Regarding Physical Activity in Chronic Pain Management.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06605729,"Chronic pain is a globally increasing problem, with enormous impact on the individual and society. Within the treatment of chronic pain, physical activity is a key strategy to improve pain-related complaints. There is ample evidence that physical activity has numerous benefits and few drawbacks. However, the literature shows that those who experience chronic pain experience difficulty performing and sustaining physical activity, and several barriers emerge that hinder physical activity. Patients indicate a need for the supportive role of the health care provider when it comes to guidance toward physically active lifestyle. On the other hand, caregivers find it difficult to fill this role. This can cause frustration for both parties, with a negative impact on the delivery of care.

Within the treatment of chronic pain, the physiotherapist is an important healthcare provider. However, it is currently not clear how physiotherapists fulfill their role in the treatment of a patient with chronic pain. It is also not known what the current knowledge is among physiotherapists on chronic pain management, what the perceptions and beliefs around physical activity in the treatment of chronic pain are, and what the clinical decisions are that they make in the treatment of chronic pain in terms of physical activity.

To obtain the best and broadest possible answers to these research questions, this study will examine these themes among physiotherapists with respect to two patient groups; namely, patients who experience persistent pain after completing their cancer treatment and individuals with chronic low back pain.

Demographic data such as age, employment, occupational specializations, etc. is gathered. Furthermore, knowledge of chronic pain, underlying thoughts and perceptions around chronic pain and physical activity, and clinical decisions of a physiotherapist in treating a patient with chronic pain, including decisions about physical activity will be examined.

In addition, this study also investigates whether an elearning around chronic pain and physical activity, has an effect on these knowledge and treatment actions.

Participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires at 2 time points via an online platform. A first measurement moment happens at the start of the study, after this the participant gets access to the elearning, the second measurement moment happens 30 days after the first measurement moment."

Totally implanted vascular access devices are known as ""ports,"" and port catheters are commonly used due to their lower risk of infection. To maintain the port system and prevent infection, the port needle should be replaced every 5-7 days. During the course of treatment, pediatric hematology-oncology patients undergo frequently repeated procedures associated with high levels of pain and distress. Pain and distress resulting from repeated procedures are often uncomfortable symptoms for pediatric patients and their families. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to reduce pain and anxiety during port needle procedures in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. One pharmacological method, distraction, increases pain tolerance by focusing attention away from the painful stimulus. This technique is used as a powerful tool for pain and anxiety management in pediatric pain. Virtual reality glasses, used as a distraction method, provide access to an interactive, three-dimensional, computer-simulated environment through a head-mounted device that blocks out real-world views. It is stated that distraction with virtual reality is a beneficial non-pharmacological method for children during hospital-based needle applications for pediatric patients. This study evaluated the effect of virtual reality on pain, fear, and emotional appearance related to needle procedures in pediatric hematology-oncology patients during port needle changes."
NCT06605287,The Progress of Diabetes After Supaglutide Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06605287,"Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) can enhance insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose concentration dependent manner, delay gastric emptying, and reduce food intake through central appetite inhibition, thus achieving the effect of lowering glucose. Supaglutide Injection (YN-011, DiabegoneÂ®) has the characteristic of high affinity with GLP-1 receptors. Previous studies by Weng Jianping had shown that early use of short-term insulin fortification and oral medication (sulfonylureas and metformin) fortification therapy for newly diagnosed T2DM still resulted in clinical remission in about 50% of patients one year after discontinuation of medication, i.e. no hypoglycemic drugs were used, only diet and exercise therapy were maintained. At the same time, early fortification therapy can promote pancreatic islets Î² Cell repair. At present, there are few studies on the clinical remission rate of diabetes after GLP-1RA hypoglycemic treatment for one year. This study aims to discontinue the use of Supaglutide treatment after 52 or 28 weeks, and continue a one-year non pharmacological intervention observation to observe the clinical remission rate of diabetes, the changes in pancreatic islets Î² and Î± cell function, insulin resistance, body composition, and blood glucose fluctuations of patients who stopped using Supaglutide for 3 months and 1 year ."

NCT06604780,Reducing Early Readmission to an Acute Psychiatric Unit,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06604780,"Early readmission to psychiatric units poses a significant challenge for both patients with mental health issues and healthcare institutions. It hampers patient progress and prognosis, and the professional approach taken during discharge can greatly influence the recovery process. This paper proposes a multicomponent discharge transition intervention to mitigate the risk of early readmission to a Mental Health Hospitalization Unit (MHHU).

The intervention entails developing a measurement scale to assess patients' risk of early readmission, allowing for stratification into high, medium, and low-risk categories. Tailored intervention strategies will focus on ensuring adherence and continuity of care post-discharge, with a more comprehensive approach for high-risk patients. Additionally, a post-discharge psychotherapeutic group will be incorporated for high-risk cases to support recovery. The efficacy of the program will be analyzed by comparing the overall early readmission risk at the Regional Hospital of Malaga's MHHU with the previous year, using admission episodes from two other hospitals in the province as a control group where the intervention program is not implemented. The success of the post-discharge group psychotherapeutic intervention will be evaluated through pre-post assessments of recovery measures, functionality, subjective well-being, social support, and treatment satisfaction.

This proposal aims to address the issue of early readmission to psychiatric units by enhancing predictability and understanding of intervention strategies to reduce readmission rates."

1. Reduce anxiety levels in children before and after surgery compared to standard sedative medication.

\*\*Who can participate?\*\*

* Children aged 7 to 12 years
* Undergoing minor orthopedic surgery lasting less than 60 minutes
* Eligible for regional anesthesia

\*\*Study Process\*\*

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

1. VR Group: Children will use VR headsets to immerse themselves in calming virtual environments before and during the surgery.
2. Standard Care Group: Children will receive standard sedative medication before surgery.

The study will measure:

* Levels of anxiety before and after surgery using a specific anxiety meter (CAM-S).
* Stress hormone levels (cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline) from blood samples.
* Pain levels at different times after surgery.
* How well children cooperate during medical procedures.
* Satisfaction levels of children, parents, and surgeons.

The study is being conducted by IRCCS - Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli in Bologna, Italy. It is a non-profit study funded by donations.

The goal is to find out if VR can reduce the need for sedatives, decrease anxiety and pain, and improve the overall surgical experience for children."

NCT06604156,Anesthesia Induction Scheme for Painless Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Patients Based on Nociceptive Stimulation Monitoring,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06604156,"The monitoring of noxious stimuli plays a crucial role in anesthesia management, particularly during general anesthesia. In recent years, new monitoring systems such as qCON and qNOX have been introduced into clinical practice to quantify the depth of sedation and analgesia. These systems analyze electroencephalographic activity to more accurately assess patients\&#39; stress responses and pain levels, thereby assisting anesthesiologists in better controlling the dosages of sedative and analgesic medications and avoiding the risks associated with inadequate or excessive sedation.The high incidence of gastric and colorectal cancers has made gastrointestinal endoscopy an important diagnostic tool. However, traditional gastrointestinal endoscopy can cause discomfort and even fear in patients, leading to a growing application of painless endoscopy. Nevertheless, painless gastrointestinal endoscopy may also be associated with certain complications, particularly in elderly patients who may have multiple health issues that need consideration. To ensure the safety and efficacy of painless gastrointestinal endoscopy, it is essential to accurately control the depth of sedation and continuously monitor patients\&#39; physiological responses.This study aims to explore a safe and effective sedation depth protocol by integrating qCON and qNOX technologies with other clinical monitoring methods. This approach not only helps alleviate patient discomfort but also enhances the quality and safety of the procedure, ultimately improving the overall healthcare experience for patients."

NCT06604052,A Study Comparing Laparoscopic/Robotic Stoma Reduced-Port Fusion Surgery with Traditional Surgery in Patients with Temporary Ileostomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06604052,"The traditional positioning and surgical methods for temporary ileostomy no longer meet the requirements of minimally invasive surgery: (1) Conventional stoma positioning often leads to the trocar incision being too close to the stoma site, increasing the risk of baseplate leakage and skin infection. (2) Since stoma positioning is required to be within the rectus abdominis, the proximity between the stoma and auxiliary incision can heighten difficulties in stoma bag attachment and raises the risk of fecal leakage. (3) Stoma retraction surgery within the rectus abdominis is more traumatic and complex. We introduce for the first time a modified stoma positioning and surgical method, termed Reduced-Port Fusion Surgery. This technique includes preoperative trocar/stoma fusion positioning and intraoperative trocar/stoma fusion surgery. The procedure is based on the 3R principles: Reposition - the stoma is repositioned within the Joint Trocar/Stoma Zone, allowing for more lateral placement to meet surgical needs without being confined to the rectus abdominis. Reduce Port - the same fusion point is used for both trocar insertion and stoma creation, enabling dual use of one site. Recognize - surgeons participate in stoma positioning, recognize the positioning, and follow the procedure. This prospective, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study aims to evaluate whether Reduced-Port Fusion Surgery can reduce stoma-related complications, postoperative pain, improve quality of life, and facilitate stoma retraction surgery compared to traditional methods. A total of 80 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. The experimental group will undergo Reduced-Port Fusion Surgery while the control group will receive traditional surgery."

NCT06603584,Phenotypes of Preschool Wheezing Among Children Attending Sohag University Hospital,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06603584,"Wheezing in preschool children is very common, with a wide differential diagnosis. It is essential to be sure of the exact sound that parents are describing; the term 'wheeze' is often applied to non-specific sound.Approximately one-third of children are diagnosed with wheeze in the first 3 years of life, making wheeze one of the commonest respiratory symptoms.The differential diagnosis of wheeze is wide, and different management strategies are needed depending on the underlying phenotype. The word 'wheeze' is used to describe many different sounds. That can be heard by both clincians and parent. Even if true wheeze is heard, this should not be automatically assumed to be due to bronchospasm. Airway narrowing by mucus will produce true wheeze but does not respond to bronchodilators. Similarly, airway malacia, either related to intrinsic airway wall defects or loss of alveolar tethering points, are also causes of bronchodilatorunresponsive wheeze; indeed, bronchodilators, by reducing airway smooth muscle tone, may actually worsen airway narrowing."

NCT06602687,PICSI Impact on Euploidy in Assisted Reproduction,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06602687,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major component of the cumulus complex surrounding oocytes. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) involves injection of a selected sperm into the oocyte. Embryologists select sperm with normal morphology and progressive motility. Physiologic intracytoplasmic sperm injection (PICSI) involves sperm selection for ICSI based on hyaluronan binding. Mature sperm which bind to HA have greater genomic integrity and reduced levels of DNA fragmentation. Earlier observational studies demonstrated improved outcomes in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) including improved clinical pregnancy rates, decreased miscarriage rates and higher live birth rates. A large multicentre randomized trial, the HABSelect trial, which included over 2,500 couples, found that PICSI did not improve term (\>37 weeks gestation) live birth rates compared to standard ICSI. However, mechanistic analysis of the data from the HABSelect trial showed a significant reduction in miscarriage rates, most notable in couples where the woman was aged over 37 years where a significant reduction in miscarriage rate was seen (40% with ICSI vs 15% with PICSI). A 2021 retrospective sibling oocyte study, including 45 cycles, compared fertilisation and embryo development and found higher fertilisation rate in PICSI cycles. No difference was observed in clinical pregnancy rates; miscarriage rates and live birth rates were not reported. We aim to prospectively study PICSI vs standard ICSI in sibling oocytes to investigate if PICSI improves embryological and ART outcomes, particularly fertilisation rate, embryo euploid status and miscarriage rate, where the female patient is aged over 35 years."

NCT06602635,Hybrid Score to Predict OTVA-SOO in Patients with Wide Basal QRS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06602635,"Outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OTVA) is the most common type of ventricular arrhythmia, and catheter ablation (CA) is the primary treatment option for patients experiencing symptoms. Accurately identifying the origin site of OTVA is essential for effective catheter ablation, minimizing procedural risks, and enhancing treatment success. However, most studies that developed algorithms or scoring systems for distinguishing OTVA origins excluded participants with structural heart disease and those with paced rhythms from their study groups. A recent prospective evaluation of a hybrid score (HS) that integrates both clinical and ECG data to predict OTVA-SOO, including patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices and those with structural heart disease in our study.

The presented study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the previously described hybrid algorithm in predicting OTVA-SOO in a patient population characterized by a wide basal QRS due to intraventricular conduction defects or paced rhythms.

The Hybrid Score The Hybrid Score (HS), involves a sum of points based on clinical and ECG characteristics. Points are assigned as follows: one point each for being over 50 years old, male, and having arterial hypertension. ECG-based points are allocated according to QRS transition: 3 points for a transition in V1, 2 points for V2, 1 point for V3 if the R-wave in V3 is greater than 1 mV; 1 point is subtracted if V3 has an R-wave less than 1 mV, and further deductions or additions apply for transitions up to V6. A score â‰¤ 1 suggests an RVOT origin, whereas â‰¥ 2 suggests an LVOT origin.

ECGs were recorded with a standard configuration at a 25 mm/s sweep speed.

This strategic integration of technology aims to address gaps identified in previous studies and enhance the effectiveness of post-TAVI patient care. One significant concern after TAVI is the development of heart conduction abnormalities on the ECG and abnormal rhythms, such as heart block, potentially requiring permanent pacemaker insertion. Addressing these rhythm issues is crucial for reducing the overall length of stay.

The main question it aims to answer is: Does a remote patient monitoring protocol-driven strategy reduce post-TAVI hospital length of stay and adverse events? Participants post-TAVI procedure and eligible for same-day discharge, as determined by their primary cardiologist, will be randomized upon informed consent into the active arm (remote monitoring) or control group (standard of care).

Participants in the active arm will: receive four remote monitoring devices. Receive support from a validated clinical decision-making algorithm for further management.

Participants in the control group will: adhere to the best standard of care as per current practice.

Often described by patients as a feeling of ""feet getting glued to the floor,"" FoG is formally defined as a ""brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk."" This debilitating gait phenomena is very common in PD, occurring in up to 80% of individuals with severe PD. When FoG arrests walking, serious consequences can occur such as loss of balance, falls, injurious events, consequent fear of falling, and increased hospitalization. Wearable robots are capable of augmenting spatiotemporal gait mechanics and are emerging as viable solutions for locomotor assistance in various neurological populations. For the proposed study, our goal is to understand how low force mechanical assistance from soft robotic apparel can best mitigate gait decline preceding a freezing episode and subsequent onset of FoG by improving spatial (e.g. stride length) and temporal features (e.g. stride time variability) of walking. We hypothesize that the ongoing gait-preserving effects can essentially minimize the accumulation of motor errors that lead to FoG. Importantly, the autonomous assistance provided by the wearable robot circumvents the need for cognitive or attentional resources, thereby minimizing risks for overloading the cognitive systems -- a known trigger for FoG, thus enhancing the repeatability and robustness of FoG-preventing effects."

NCT06601179,"Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of the ""HIFU"" High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia;",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06601179,"Prostate adenoma, also known as benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia (BPH), involves an increase in the size of the prostate, forming a benign tumor. It is the most common benign tumor in men, generally affecting those over 40 years old. The risk of BPH is more than 50% in men aged 50 to 60 and rises to 90% in men by age 80.

This hyperplasia leads to altered urinary flow and bladder outlet obstruction, referred to as ""lower urinary tract symptoms"" or LUTS, which become more frequent with age. These symptoms are categorized as obstructive or irritative. In the early stages, men with BPH may have difficulty starting urination and may feel as if their bladder is not completely empty. As a result, they need to urinate more often, especially at night, a condition known as nocturia. Additionally, the volume and velocity of the urinary flow may decrease significantly, as evidenced by flow measurements, and residual urine discharge may occur at the end of urination.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a medical technique that uses high-intensity ultrasonic waves to treat various medical conditions, including malignant and benign tumors, without the need for invasive surgery or ionizing radiation. HIFU generates heat between 80Â° to 95Â°C at the focal point, causing necrosis of the targeted area with pinpoint accuracy. In urology, HIFU is used to treat prostate cancer in a minimally invasive manner, with focused ultrasounds delivered endorectally using a transducer that targets the treatment area with real-time monitoring.

Exclusively targeted HIFU treatment has been suggested for BPH, where localized necrosis of the side lobes reduces the volume of the prostatic transition zone, alleviating compression of the prostatic urethra and improving urinary symptoms.

This new study was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIFU for BPH treatment."
NCT06601153,Health Improvements by Understanding the Determinants of Residual Risk in Coronary Artery Disease and New Targets for Prevention and Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06601153,"Current medical treatments, in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), mainly target established risk factors and are able to reduce morbidity and mortality but still leave a substantial residual risk of coronary artery disease progression and events. The main hypothesis of this study is that metabolic derangement, including pre-diabetes, elevated levels of triglycerides, low levels and functionality of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, often associated with a chronic inflammatory state, is a currently unrecognized and undertreated conditon which could be the most relevant determinant of residual risk.

The goal of HURRICANE observational study is to discover specific individual genetic/molecular profiles subtending emerging cardiometabolic and vascular risk patterns and associating with a more severe and progressive coronary artery disease. We will thus develop and preliminary validate new predictive models for the recognition of high-risk patients and explore possible new targets for individualized preventive treatment.

NCT06601101,Effects of Topical Insulin on Corneal Epithelium Healing After Corneal Crosslinking in Patients With Keratoconus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06601101,"The cornea plays a fundamental role in vision, being a complex tissue essential for ocular health. In ophthalmological practice, there are situations such as corneal crosslinking, where damage to the corneal epithelium occurs. Crosslinking is a surgical procedure aimed at strengthening collagen bonds in the corneal stroma to prevent the progression of keratoconus, through the application of topical riboflavin followed by ultraviolet (UV-A) radiation. To enhance the effectiveness of riboflavin and UV-A radiation, the corneal epithelium needs to be removed, which can cause postoperative pain and discomfort, as well as increase the risk of complications such as infections, scarring, corneal opacities, perforations, and recurrent epithelial erosions. Several growth factors play a role in epithelial healing, and the discovery of insulin in the tear film and the presence of insulin and Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1) receptors in the cornea has raised the hypothesis that insulin may modulate the cornea's wound healing response. Since then, topical insulin has been used for various ocular pathologies, including dry eye disease, persistent epithelial defects, and neurotrophic ulcers. Based on this knowledge, studies have been developed, and promising results regarding the use of insulin in corneal healing have been reported, providing a scientific foundation for the realization of this project. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of insulin eye drops at a concentration of 50 IU/ml on epithelial healing in non-diabetic patients undergoing epithelial debridement for corneal crosslinking. To this end, a randomized, double-masked clinical trial will be conducted with two groups, one being the control group, in which researchers will compare the epithelial healing rate in mmÂ²/h between the insulin group and the placebo group, as the primary outcome. Patients diagnosed with keratoconus and with an indication for the crosslinking procedure, will be invited to participate. As a result of the study, it is expected to assess and quantify the impact of topical insulin on epithelial defect closure in patients undergoing crosslinking, compared to placebo. Topical insulin may contribute to early epithelial defect closure, control of inflammation, and prevention of complications that could significantly impact visual quality."

NCT06600958,IDENTIFICATION OF BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY AND RADIO-CLINICAL PROGRESSION OF KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600958,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is an heterogeneous disease, both symptomatically and structurally, with very different evolving profiles. Although several serum, urinary or synovial biomarkers have been developed in knee OA, their interest as potential predictive factors of clinical and structural progression remains poorly known. Similarly, to date, no biological predictive markers of response to OA treatments have been validated, particularly for intra-articular treatments \[corticosteroids (CTC), hyaluronic acid (HA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP)\]. Finally, although cohorts of OA patients have already been established in the past, none of them has made it possible to establish a biobank of serum and synovial fluid obtained from the same patient at inclusion but also during the follow-up of the OA disease, up to the joint replacement.

The investigators hypothesize that some biomarkers in serum, PRP and synovial fluid in knee OA:

* are be correlated with the clinical symptoms and radiological lesions, thus allowing to define distinct clusters of patients whose clinical and radiological evolving profile could be different
* are correlated with the clinical evolution (pain and functional limitation)
* can predict the radiographic progression but also in the long term the necessity of joint replacement
* could constitute predictive factors of response to intra-articular treatments (CTC, HA and PRP).

To validate theses hypothesis, investigators will conduct a longitudinal cohort study with long term follow-up until joint replacement in patients with knee OA. In parallel to this longitudinal study, a cross-sectional ancillary study will be conducted to compare the levels of different serum and synovial biomarkers between subjects with knee OA and subjects with chronic inflammatory rheumatism (rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis)

- Longitudinal study To study the correlations between changes in clinical symptoms (pain, function, quality of life, effusion, flare-up) / radiographic progression during the follow-up on the one hand, and the levels of biomarkers in serum, PRP and synovial fluid at inclusion / their variations at different times of the study on the other hand.

B/ Secondary objectives

* Longitudinal study

  1. To study the correlations between clinical (pain, function, quality of life, effusion, congestive flare) / radiographic phenotype on the one hand, and serum, PRP, and synovial biomarker values at each follow-up visit.
  2. To assess the prognostic value of clinical, biological or clinico-biological clusters on the ultimate outcome of OA defined by joint replacement.
  3. To assess the prognostic value of different serum and synovial biomarkers on the structural progression during the follow-up.

  6. To study the distribution of cellular populations in the joint fluid (synoviocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, mesenchymal stem cells) according to the clinical and radiographic phenotype
  7. To assess the correlations between the level of different biomarkers in serum, synovial fluid and their levels on tissue samples from OA joint obtained during joint replacement.
  8. To study in vitro the effect of purified glycosamninoglycan (GAG) from synovial fluid and PRP on the metabolism of synoviocytes, macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells from autologous synovial fluid
  9. To study in vitro the effect of purified GAGs from synovial fluid and PRP on the metabolism of synoviocytes, chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells obtained from human joint tissue samples (synovial membrane, cartilage) obtained during joint replacement.
* Cross-sectional study

  1. To assess the correlations between clinical symptoms (pain, function, quality of life, effusion, congestive flare) and radiographic phenotype and serum and synovial biomarkers at inclusion.

NCT06600555,Evaluation of the Metabolic Surgery Technique for Glycemic Improvement in Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600555,"Surgery is one of the management options for type 2 diabetes in patients with moderate obesity. This is a recent option because it has been part of the recommendations since October 2022.

The possible surgical techniques are the same as those for bariatric surgery:

* Sleeve,
* Bypass,
* Gastric band, but the main goal is not weight loss, it is remission of type 2 diabetes. It is called metabolic surgery.

The ring technique (gastroplasty) is practiced less and less in France because it is less effective in weight loss and is responsible for major discomfort.

Currently, metabolic surgery is one of the recommendations but no study has compared the effectiveness of the techniques with each other. One or other of the techniques can be chosen according to the preferences of the surgeon, the patient, the center, etc. but this choice is not made objectively, in the absence of comparative data.

This study would like to follow up on patients for whom metabolic surgery has been proposed by the doctor,.

If the surgery is accepted, this study would like to improve knowledge of the effectiveness of the different techniques, and thus demonstrate which metabolic surgery technique is preferred in terms of effectiveness and safety."

NCT06600516,Assessing Modified CBTi in Adults with Insomnia Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600516,"Sleep is a biological need, crucial for maintaining overall health and resiliency. Sleep disorders disrupt this normal functioning. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent sleep disorder and yields costs to the U.S. Healthcare System in billions of dollars per year. Chronic insomnia has been linked to numerous physical and psychological health outcomes as well as increased mortality.

There is also evidence that insomnia is a risk factor for worse inflammation, worse neurological functioning, cognitive performance, and mild cognitive impairment, including cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and faster genetic and brain aging. Moreover, in patients with Alzheimer's disease those with insomnia showed a faster progression to dementia. Better sleep health provides neuroprotection against this decline. Impairment in objective and subjective cognitive performance, highlights the utility of treating insomnia to potentially improve cognitive outcomes during midlife and insomnia symptoms are a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is the gold-standard, first line recommended treatment for insomnia, and has considerably better long-term outcomes than medications. CBTi decreases insomnia symptom severity by 50%. CBTi also appears to improve cognitive functioning. However, CBTi is underutilized, training is limited, and medical professionals are implementing treatment approaches inconsistent with empirically supported guidelines. Insomnia symptoms are being inadequately treated while misinformation and misconceptions about insomnia disorder, CBTi, and actual therapeutic effects are being propagated. Moreover, sedating medications are currently the most commonly used treatment for insomnia, which is problematic because the potential side effects can have major implications for the aging population. Additionally, some patients continue to experience insomnia symptoms even when taking sleep medication, which can lead to increase dosages, dependence on, and tolerance to these medications, further emphasizing the importance of CBTi. There is also a need for more readily accessible, short-term, modified treatments for insomnia disorder. A modified format of CBTi may assist in dissemination of effective treatments while also providing the potential for adapting this treatment to specific client characteristics. To address this need, we will modify CBTi and conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to test these modifications.

The proposed project will include two primary aims in establishing a foundation needed to examine individual benefits of the components of CBTi. These aims will aid in the continuation of investigation to better assess treatment outcomes, create transdiagnostic treatment plans, and provide individualized health care through accessible psychotherapy. Obtaining a better understanding of the predictors of successful treatment may improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of successful treatment. Ultimately, this improved understanding may help to improve treatment for insomnia disorder, improve cognitive functioning, and potentially reduced risk for cognitive decline associated with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. Improved treatment outcomes utilizing specific core components of CBTi may result in improvements of insomnia disorder and cognitive functioning and would provide a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms underlying the etiology and maintenance of insomnia as well as how risks associated with mild cognitive impairment and cognitive decline might be mitigated. Lastly, this proposed project allows for proof of concept and for collaborations to be made within the medical and mental health communities in Pocatello, ID and surrounding areas, decreasing barriers to treatment and improving treatment dissemination."

NCT06600308,Walking ANalysis Interest in Persons with FacioscapulohumEral Muscular Dystrophies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600308,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH) is one of the most common genetic myopathies in adults. It is characterised by progressive asymmetric muscular atrophy affecting the skeletal muscles of the face, upper limbs and then lower limbs, causing problems with walking, which is one of the most frequent complaints of these patients. In fact, 20% of people with FSH require a wheelchair from the age of 60. To date, scientific research into FSH has focused mainly on the molecular level, enabling potential therapeutic targets to be identified. Trials of gene therapies and other drug therapies are gradually emerging, with the aim of having a positive impact on these people\&#39;s functional abilities, particularly walking difficulties. However, few studies have looked at the functional impact of FSH on these people, and in particular at the specific analysis of their walking ability In France, the functional assessment of FSH is carried out using a clinical reference scale called the Motor Function Measurement (MFM), the D1 sub-score of which studies items relating to standing and transfers. However, this scale does not objectively and specifically study gait disorders, and its application requires a great deal of time (at least 30 minutes) and specific training leading to certification, limiting its use in practice almost exclusively to centres of expertise and reference for neuromuscular diseases. The NeuroMuscular Score-D1 (NM-score D1), linked to the MFM D1 sub-score, is the only French scale validated in the literature for assessing the severity of gait disorders in FSH, but it is very little used in current practice because it is little known and only descriptive.

Certain functional tests of walking ability (so-called \&#34;short-duration\&#34; tests such as the 10-metre test at comfortable and fast speeds, the Time Up and Go test \[TUG\], and so-called \&#34;long-duration\&#34; tests such as the 6-minute test \[TM6\]) exist and are much simpler to use in clinical practice, do not require certification and can be carried out in a shorter time. However, to date there is no consensus on the use of these walking tests in FSH. Furthermore, their ecological capabilities (i.e. their ability to reflect what happens in real life) are not really known. In this sense, technological developments in quantified gait analysis (QGA) could help to assess locomotion disorders (of neurological, muscular or joint origin, etc.) more effectively and objectively. A more consensual use of gait tests in FSH with the use of innovative connected tools that are accessible (e.g. use of inertial units to measure spatio-temporal gait parameters during gait tests) in clinical routine would make it possible to obtain new gait analysis data to explore gait disorders more specifically and in a simple, rapid and objective manner, and thus improve and optimise the day-to-day monitoring of these patients by a large proportion of healthcare professionals.

The aim of the WANTED project is therefore to assess the value of quick and easy walking tests as part of the functional evaluation of patients with FSH by studying the correlation between the data obtained with these walking tests and that obtained with the MFM, the reference method, and also with data obtained in real-life conditions (e.g. physical activity time via actimetry)."
NCT06600295,"Oncology, Undernutrition and Sensoriality: Links, Mechanisms and Levers for Action",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600295,"Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract account for around 4% of all malignant tumours worldwide. Colon and liver cancer are the most common digestive cancers. The epidemiology of liver cancer is changing, and the number of deaths from liver cancer has increased by 25% worldwide (Huang 2022). In France, around 19,000 cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and 88,000 new cases of digestive cancer are diagnosed each year (colon cancer remains the most common) (Globocan 2020). Patients with these two types of cancer are at particularly high risk of undernutrition (Pressoir 2010; Gyan 2018).

In cancer patients, changes in diet may result from constraints linked to the cancer or possible after-effects, but also from personal choices (for example, adopting a healthier diet). Cancer and its treatment lead to changes such as increased nutritional requirements and hypercatabolism, or sensory changes (taste and smell), reducing pleasure and food intake. These problems will impair quality of life and intensify undernutrition, a major problem in the management of the disease since it increases the risk of complications, therapeutic failure and mortality. It is estimated that 10-20% of deaths in cancer patients are attributable to the consequences of undernutrition rather than to the disease itself (Pressoir 2010). In the VICAN study, 41% of patients changed their diet after diagnosis: 29% because of changes in taste and 82% to have a healthier diet (INCa 2014). These changes were associated with the treatment received, the presence of sequelae and anxiety.

Taste and smell disorders are common in different types of cancer (any solid or haematological type) and treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery) (De Conno 1989; Heckel 2015; Spotten 2017; van Oort 2018). The mechanisms involved in sensory changes are not fully understood, especially in cancer, and with different types and treatments (Murtaza 2017). Several hypotheses have been proposed: altered expression of enzymes of the oral sphere, altered expression of sensory receptors (Neiers 2021), saliva composition and function (Zhu 2021), and impact of the oral microbiota (Schwartz 2021a, Licandro 2023).

The early identification of undesirable effects linked to nutrition, and the early or anticipated diagnosis of undernutrition are important issues in the management of cancer patients. The pleasure (or displeasure) produced by food guides desire and eating behaviour. The mechanisms involved are linked to hedonic sensations: conditioned satiety, specific sensory satiety, negative alliesthesia and the reward system (hedonic system). The latter is influenced by the environment and can be consciously controlled, with several dimensions: liking (the patient likes or dislikes a given food) and wanting (evaluates the desire to consume a given food at a given moment). All these parameters, together with sensory and dietary learning throughout life (habits, beliefs and constraints), influence food preferences and therefore eating behaviour. Individual sensitivities and the personal history of the disease (treatment and care pathway, sequelae, presence of co-morbidities, etc.) must therefore be taken into account when setting up preventive actions for cancer patients. It seems important to explore these factors, the experience of patients and the consequences for eating behaviour in daily life, in order to improve support and communication with healthcare professionals, as well as prevention and early detection of undernutrition. It would be interesting to conduct more in-depth studies on nutritional status, quality of life and changes in taste and smell, which in most studies have been considered separately."
NCT06600269,Cycling-Based Priming Coordination Training for Enhancing Ataxia Recovery and Brain Plasticity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06600269,"Effective walking and balance require not only lower limb muscle strength but also coordinated movement. For individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA), rehabilitation strategies targeting coordination are essential to improving mobility and reducing the burden on caregivers. However, evidence-based rehabilitation approaches for ataxia remain limited.

Recent studies suggest that improvements in motor learning are often accompanied by changes in cortical excitability. Abnormal cortical excitability in SCA patients may hinder rehabilitation efforts, yet priming strategies-such as exercise or specific stimuli-have been shown to enhance motor learning by modulating cortical excitability. Cycling exercise, in particular, has demonstrated the potential to improve coordination and influence cortical plasticity in individuals with SCA, making it a promising priming strategy for coordination training.

This clinical trial aims to:

1. Investigate the priming effect and neural mechanisms of acute cycling exercise on coordination training in patients with SCA.
2. Explore the long-term impact of priming cycling training on cortical plasticity and functional mobility in individuals with SCA.

This study seeks to provide insights into optimized rehabilitation interventions that could enhance the quality of life and independence for people with SCA."

NCT06599359,"Intention to Leave, Job Stress, Burnout, and Job Satisfaction Among Pharmacists in Lebanon",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06599359,"In Lebanon, the situation of pharmacists is complicated by external factors such as economic instability and healthcare system challenges. The economic crisis has led to financial strain for many pharmacists, affecting their income and job security. Additionally, shortages of medications and medical supplies, along with high patient loads, contribute to increased job stress and burnout. Political instability adds another layer of uncertainty and stress, impacting the overall mental well-being of healthcare professionals. Recent studies emphasize the need for interventions to mitigate job stress and burnout among pharmacists. No study has comprehensively assessed these themes among pharmacists in Lebanon, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of the economic crisis. This study aims to test the dynamics of intention to leave, job stress, burnout, and job satisfaction among pharmacists due to their significant impact on healthcare delivery."
NCT06599346,Effects of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Supernatant on Prevention and Treatment of Skin/Mucosal Injury in Hematology Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06599346,"This clinical trial is studying the effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture supernatant on the prevention and treatment of mucosal injuries in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is a common treatment for blood-related cancers and other serious blood disorders. However, many patients experience severe damage to their mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth, skin, and bladder, due to the high-dose chemotherapy used in the treatment process. These mucosal injuries can cause pain, increase the risk of infection, and lower the patient's quality of life.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether MSC culture supernatant can help repair mucosal injuries and improve recovery for these patients. MSC culture supernatant contains substances produced by mesenchymal stem cells that may promote healing and reduce inflammation. These substances could potentially repair tissue without the risks associated with using live cells.

Participants in this trial will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive standard care, and the other will receive MSC culture supernatant as part of their treatment. The study will look at how well MSC supernatant helps heal mucosal injuries, as well as its safety and any side effects that may occur. The outcomes of this study could lead to new ways to prevent and treat mucosal injuries in patients undergoing HSCT, improving their quality of life during and after treatment.

The trial will include 120 patients who have undergone HSCT and experienced mucosal injuries. The study will last approximately five years, from October 2020 to September 2025. Participants will be monitored throughout the trial for safety and effectiveness of the treatment, with follow-up visits scheduled to assess their progress."

NCT06598891,PAS Balance Training for Parkinson Disease (PD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06598891,"Gait initiation (GI) difficulty is a common problem in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), often linked to impaired anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). Currently, there are no targeted rehabilitation programs designed specifically for GI-related APA in PD patients. Research has shown that while motor learning deficits are common in PD, explicit learning is better preserved than implicit learning. Therefore, a GI-related APA training system using an explicit learning model could be particularly effective for this population.

During motor learning, long-term potentiation (LTP) increases the excitability of the primary motor cortex. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) has been demonstrated to induce LTP-like changes in the motor cortex, making it a potential priming method to enhance motor learning. However, the priming effect of PAS targeted at leg muscles and the motor cortex on motor learning related to GI-APA has not been previously studied.

The objectives of this study are:

1. To investigate the effects of explicit and implicit training on GI-related APA.
2. To evaluate the priming effect of PAS on GI-related APA training and the associated plasticity changes in the motor cortex."
NCT06598878,AR Gait Training for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06598878,"Gait disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in complex environments or under stress, present challenges for accurate evaluation and classification, such as in cases of freezing of gait. Traditional clinical and laboratory settings often fail to replicate the complexity needed for precise classification, making effective rehabilitation difficult. This study aims to address these challenges by developing an augmented reality (AR)-based environment that mimics real-world stressors and dynamically adapts to the patient's condition. The AR system is designed to facilitate individualized gait training and rehabilitation by modifying environmental difficulty based on real-time feedback from gait performance and stress levels.

Building on Gentile's taxonomy of tasks, we have incorporated PD-specific factors, such as cognitive dual tasks, into our environment classification system. Preliminary results suggest that this system effectively elicits varying gait and heart rate variability (HRV) responses, indicating different stress levels.

This trial will further test the AR environment's ability to classify patients based on their responses to complex, interactive environments, while also investigating the effects of adaptive AR-based gait training on both gait and stress management in individuals with PD."

NCT06598098,MAMA Tot - Healthy Weight Parallel Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06598098,"The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct a longitudinal prospective study of healthy pregnant women and their offspring to determine which antenatal maternal exercise mode(s) will have the greatest impact on maternal and infant cardiometabolic health. This information may lead to modified clinical practice recommendations that improve health in childhood and possibly beyond. This randomized controlled trial will recruit 268 healthy pregnant women randomized to an exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, aerobic and resistance exercise) or to no exercise (usual care); their infants will be measured at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. This rigorous design will test our central hypothesis that aerobic and resistance exercise and resistance exercise training during pregnancy will, in healthy weight BMI (HW) women, improve maternal and offspring cardiometabolic outcomes to a greater extent than AE alone. We will test this hypothesis with two specific aims:

Aim 1. Determine the influence of different exercise modes during HW pregnancy on infant cardiometabolic health and growth trajectories. Hypothesis: AE, RE, and AERE by HW pregnant women will improve offspring neuromotor and cardiometabolic measures at 1, 6, and 12 months postpartum (e.g. decreased % body fat, BMI z-score, heart rate, non-HDL, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP); increased insulin sensitivity) compared to infants of HW pregnant women that do not exercise; AERE and RE will have the greatest impact on improving infant measures.

Aim 2. Determine the most effective exercise mode in HW pregnancy on improving maternal cardiometabolic health outcomes. Hypothesis: AE, RE, and AERE by HW pregnant women will improve both maternal cardiometabolic health measures (e.g. decreased BMI z-score, non-HDL, % body fat, HR, weight gain) across pregnancy (16 to 36 weeks gestation) and overall pregnancy outcomes (e.g. lower incidence of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, hypertension during gestation) compared to HW pregnant women that do not exercise; AERE and RE will have the greatest impact on improving maternal health measures, with the AERE group having the highest compliance.

The proposed innovative study will be the first to provide a critical understanding of the influence of antenatal exercise modes upon the cardiometabolic health and growth trajectories of offspring who may be at increased risk of poor outcomes. This work will have a significant impact on reducing the cycle of OB and CVD, potentially providing the earliest and most efficacious intervention to attenuate or prevent OB and CVD in the next generation."

NCT06597617,Persistent Organic Pollutants and Mechanical Discharge: Limiting the Impact of Bariatric Surgery Through Personalized Adapted Physical Activity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06597617,"For the most severe cases of obesity, recourse to bariatric surgery is the ultimate solution. Although highly beneficial to individual health, this massive loss of body mass could also have negative effects on metabolism and neuromuscular function. Unfortunately, these effects have been relatively little studied in the scientific literature, and are poorly taken into account in patient follow-up when bariatric surgery has been recommended. One of the adverse effects of bariatric surgery is the release into the bloodstream of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) which, are not only persistent, but also bioaccumulative, toxic and mobile. The major problem is that these circulating POPs are linked to a number of adverse side effects, including reproductive disorders, neurobehavioral alterations, metabolic disorders, gut microbiota alterations inflammatory changes and physiological alterations. POP neurotoxicity could also affect psychomotor abilities and neuromuscular function. In addition, the mechanical unloading (i.e., reduced mechanical stress on muscles) induced by loss of body mass, an effect targeted by bariatric surgery and largely beneficial to the health of individuals, could also alter neuromuscular function and potentially alter muscle architecture and contractile properties. Unfortunately, no data are currently available in the scientific literature to confirm or refute these hypotheses. Physical activity-based intervention strategies may be usefull to counteract the effects of mechanical unloading and the release of POPs as suggested in scientific literature. However it is also possible to question which exercise modality should be preferred. Our hypothesis is that eccentric muscle strengthening would better preserve muscle mass and neuromuscular function while limiting the risks associated with POPs release, compared with an aerobic and a control group."

T2D is common in older adults and can lead to severe issues such as heart disease, disability, and early death. While regular exercise is known to help manage T2D, many people with the condition find it difficult to stay active. This study explores HT as a simple, non-invasive treatment that may offer similar benefits.

Participants will wear special leg sleeves that deliver heat to their legs for 90 minutes each day at home over 12 weeks. The study\&#39;s primary goal is to assess whether HT treatment at home is feasible and safe to use.

NCT06596954,Lymphocyte-sparing Thoracic Radiotherapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06596954,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors. Although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with surgery has significantly improved the survival rate of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, approximately half of the patients will experience local regional recurrence or distant metastasis. Lymphocytes are crucial immune cells in the human body, playing a key role in combating infections and tumor development. In recent years, an increasing body of research has indicated that lymphocyte depletion is a significant factor associated with poor prognosis in various solid tumors, including esophageal cancer. The lymphocyte depletion caused by radiotherapy has garnered considerable attention from oncologists. However, there is still a lack of prospective clinical research data on lymphocyte protection in thoracic tumors. Therefore, this study aims to provide high-level evidence from evidence-based medicine regarding the correlation between lymphocyte depletion and prognosis in esophageal cancer patients, offering more effective strategies and methods to improve the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer."

NCT06596525,Effects of Barefoot vs. Shod Whole Body Vibration Training in Children With Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06596525,"Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of lifelong conditions that affect the development of movement and coordination that lead to activity limitations due to damage to the developing fetal or neonatal brain tissue. Although the brain lesion is static, it can lead to progressive musculoskeletal system problems. As a result of the restriction of ankle joint range of motion and many microscopic changes in the muscle structure, plantar pressure distribution is impaired in children with CP which brings about gait and balance problems. Moreover, since physical activity may be restricted due to spasticity, poor motor control, muscle weakness and balance problems; the main goals in CP rehabilitation are normalization of muscle tone, improving walking function by increasing joint range of motion, strength and balance and consequently improving mobility.

There is a need for adjunctive treatment methods with low side effect profiles that can be applied in the long term to prevent musculoskeletal complications and preserve existing functions in children with CP. Whole body vibration training (WBVT), is a therapeutic exercise method that is growing in popularity due to its ease of application, low side effect profile and non-invasiveness as an auxiliary treatment method to traditional rehabilitation programs. Although WBVT is suggested as an easily applicable and safe treatment method with home-type vibration devices; scientific evidence is still lacking and it has not yet been included in routine rehabilitation programs due to the small number of high-quality randomized controlled trials. This study aims to determine the efficacy of barefoot vs. shod WBVT in addition to the conventional physiotherapy, compared to the conventional physiotherapy alone, in children with mild-moderate CP on pedobarographic evaluation, balance, endurance and lower extremity functions. As a result of this study, it might possible to offer children with CP an accessible, safe and helpful treatment method with established protocols."

NCT06596369,Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation for Upper Extremity Function,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06596369,"Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (tcES) of the spinal cord has shown great promise in restoring upper extremity function after spinal cord injury (SCI). More recently, the use of invasive, epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord has also demonstrated promise in restoring upper extremity function post-stroke. However, the effect of stimulation parameters such as electrode configuration and stimulation frequency on excitability of the nervous system remains unknown preventing the opportunity to fully exploit this noninvasive stimulation paradigm. Additionally, the utility of noninvasive tcES in the stroke population remains unexplored. This project utilizes a comprehensive set of neurophysiological techniques, in combination with carefully chosen motor tasks, to directly link and assess the effects of stimulation parameters on neural excitability and upper extremity function during and following the delivery of cervical tcES in individuals with SCI and stroke. The fundamental knowledge gained from this project will ultimately improve the implementation of this novel and non-invasive neuromodulatory tool through an improved understanding of how tcES can facilitate recovery of function."

NCT06596187,Differential Assessment of Hypertonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06596187,"Spasticity and rigidity are common symptoms of central nervous system injuries, such as spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease, and result in distinct patterns of increased resistance during passive joint movements. Spasticity is characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes, accompanied by exaggerated tendon responses, while rigidity is marked by consistent resistance throughout the range of motion, traditionally considered independent of stretch velocity. However, recent studies suggest that rigidity may also be influenced by stretch velocity. This study aims to investigate muscle tone by examining spasticity, rigidity, and normal muscle function through neural and biomechanical changes. Standard clinical tools, such as the Modified Ashworth Scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, along with additional assessments like the Myoton and Post-Activation Depression (PAD), will be employed."

NCT06596096,Risk Factors for Beta-lactam Target Non Attainment in Critically Ill Patients BETALACTACRIT,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06596096,"Beta-lactams agents are time-dependent antibiotics. Their bactericidal effects are associated with the time spent above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria. In ICU patients, many pathophysiological changes may occur, which significantly alter beta-lactam pharmacokinetics (increasing in distribution volume, hypoalbuminemia or change in glomerular filtration rate...), leading to antibiotic underexposure, which may explain some treatment failures and risk of emergence of a multi-resistant bacteria.

Many guidelines advocate to reach a fixed target for the steady-state free plasma concentration of beta-lactam between 4 and 8 times of the MIC. However, clinical evidences supporting that septic patients in ICU would benefit from such optimization remain low and contradictory, and use of surrogate MICs based on critical breakpoints instead of actual MICs are significant limitations in the description of beta-lactam exposure among ICU patients with sepsis.

In this study, the investigators aim to indentify profiles of intensive care unit patients which are more likely to be associated with pharmacological failure (\< 4 time the MIC of the bacteria). The investigators also aim to identify association between failure and poor clinical outcome."

This study aims to assess the accuracy and reliability of ultrasound in determining the correct placement of gastric feeding tubes (GFTs) in intensive care patients.

Study Design

A diagnostic study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound in determining GFT placement in all ICU patients who require GFT placement. Patients will undergo ultrasound by an ultrasonographer (USG) after receiving a new or replaced GFT. The USG will assess the presence or absence of a ""mosaic sign"" after insufflation of 20 mL of air through the GFT. The mosaic sign indicates proper GFT placement in the stomach.

Methods

All ultrasonographic measurements will be recorded and saved in a central picture archiving and communication system (PACS). The images will be labeled with the deepness of the GFT (20 cm, 50 cm, or tracheobronchial) and anonymized before being presented to an intensivist expert in USG for interpretation.

Hypothesis

A 20 mL air insufflation via a GFT at the esophageal level or via a suction catheter in the tracheobronchial system will not produce a ""mosaic sign"" on ultrasound. This sign will only be present if the GFT is properly positioned in the stomach."

NCT06595147,"Breast cancEr, FITness and ExeRcise for Heart Health: The BE-FITTER Study",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06595147,"The chemotherapy medications used for breast cancer treatment are important for achieving a cure, but a potential side effect is that they can cause a decline in functional capacity (reduced exercise tolerance and impaired physical function) and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The risks of decreased functional capacity and cardiovascular disease are highest in breast cancer survivors as they grow older. The factors causing the decline in functional capacity are not well understood, however they may be related to a reduction in cardiac function (e.g. decreased pumping ability of the heart) or skeletal muscle function (reduced muscle blood flow and oxygenation). Exercise training is used for other populations at risk for cardiovascular disease (such as cardiac rehabilitation), but is not routinely offered to breast cancer survivors. Therefore this research study wants to test whether exercise training can improve heart and muscle health, and increase functional capacity in up to 60 older breast cancer survivors aged \>60 years old who previously received chemotherapy drugs that can affect the heart.

The purpose of this study is to compare two rehabilitation approaches: a 12-week structured exercise training program or a 12-week stretching-yoga program. The investigators want to compare whether these programs can improve functional capacity, and heart and skeletal muscle function. To do this, some of the participants in this study will be randomly enrolled in the structured exercise training program and others will be randomly enrolled in the stretching-yoga program."

NCT06594302,Functional Performance and Biopsychosocial Characteristics in Individuals with Systemic Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06594302,"In individuals with systemic sclerosis (SSc), the loss of functionality severely affects quality of life. This condition may cause psychosocial effects by affecting the person, their family, and the environment. Activities of daily living, quality of life, and psychosocial well-being are affected, and aesthetic concerns arise.

Different scales evaluating the quality of life, functions, and disease characteristics of individuals diagnosed with SSc are accepted. In this field, modified Rodnan skin score (mRDS), DuruÃ¶z hand index (DHI), scleroderma health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) are frequently used. The BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire is also included in the literature for the evaluation of the biopsychosocial effects of individuals with rheumatism.

In addition, it is essential to evaluate the characteristics of individuals who maintain their health with chronic diseases. Therefore, assessment parameters such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Scale, Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale, Short Form Illness Perception Scale, Body Awareness Questionnaire, Central Sensitisation Scale, and Tampa Kinesiophobia Questionnaire are frequently used in this regard. The 6 Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) is recommended as a frequently used method to determine cardiopulmonary endurance in individuals with SSc.

It is known that there is a decrease in the distance walked in this test compared to healthy individuals, and the fall potential of physical performance is an important parameter.

In addition, there are also methods used to evaluate physical performance, such as the five-repetition sit-and-stand test (CST), the Stair Climbing Test (SCT), and the Timed up-and-go test (TUG). Considering all these effects, there is a need to examine the relationship between functional and biopsychosocial impact in individuals with SSc.

This study aims to examine the relationship between functional performance and biopsychosocial characteristics in individuals diagnosed with systemic sclerosis and to present the results for this disease group."
NCT06594276,"Comparison of Efficacy in Treating Breast Abscess, With Systemic Antibiotics Against Local Instillation of Antibiotics Along With Ultrasound Guided Aspiration.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06594276,"Breast abscess, marked by localized collection of pus, frequently follows mastitis. Its prevalence soars up to 16% in the developing world. It usually presents in lactating mothers but also develops in prepubertal females as well. Conventionally it has been treated by surgical incision and drainage with antibiotic coverage, whether oral, intramuscular or intravenous. This approach requires hospital stay and general anesthesia but also have complications like scarring and disfigurement. With the financial and emotional impacts of this technique , surgeons have opted needle aspiration of breast abscess as a standardized treatment. It has been very successful in the management of breast abscess as it spares the patients from long hospital stays and the cosmetic complications. It may require to repeat the procedure till the complete resolution of symptoms which can be effectively assessed by the clinical symptoms of the patient like redness of the skin, pain, tenderness and ultrasonographical evidence of pus accumulation. Systemic antibiotics are still frequently administered for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. It has been shown in previous studies that systemic antibiotics may not be as effective as deemed earlier due to local pathogenesis. The use of local antibiotics is not a novel concept but a firmly established fact , whether its the earliest sterilization of the operative field or treating open wounds and fractures . Studies have shown great effect of local use of antibiotics in different scenarios and this may help in limit the use of antibiotics and providing the systemic bypass with maximum local impact. In patients of breast abscess, along with ultrasound guided aspiration the inclusion of locally injecting the antibiotics may reduce the frequency of procedure till the absolute resolution of symptoms and also markedly decrease the failure rate of this technique , which usually resorts to the conventional incision and drainage."

In accordance with the growing older population, who often require complex dental care, it is very important to test simple yet effective and safe solutions. Bearing in mind that POM has proven to be a good solution for conventional removable partial dentures with clasps (RPD), and that it is quite common to have 2-3 remaining teeth, a denture with a framework made of light and flexible material such as POM present a good solution. The hypothesis is that a POM telescopic denture is clinically as adequate, effective and safe as the conventional complex cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy denture with clasps. Telescopic denture should provide better comfort and longevity compared to conventional RPD because of axial loading of the abutment teeth and no negative biological effect of clasps. Moreover, conventional telescopic denture is made of precious alloys which increase their cost; therefore, POM telescopic denture present great advantage in cost/effective treatment. Telescopic crowns are comprised of inner and outer crowns; accordingly, telescopic denture represent a type of complex denture where one part is fixed on the remaining teeth (inner crowns) and other part (outer crowns and denture framework) is removable.

The key factors that will define the success of the treatment will be: assessment of dentures' retention, oral health related quality of life, presence of biological complications, presence of mechanical complications, denture appearance and chewing function assessment."
NCT06593899,The Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06593899,"For localized soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities, limb-sparing or conservative surgery with perioperative radiotherapy (RT) is the standard of care. However, several challenges persist. Notably, there are exceedingly high rates of distant metastatic recurrence even after surgical resection and RT, and conventional fractionated radiotherapy has a prolonged duration (5-6 weeks). With advancements in RT technology, the gradual expansion of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens enables significantly shorter treatment durations. Promising recent reports on 1-week hypofractionated RT regimens, such as the 5X5 Gy RT regimens, have demonstrated reasonable local control and acceptable toxicity in resectable STS.Addressing the challenge of distant metastasis, previous studies have indicated that AI regimens are expected to eliminate micrometastases and improve survival in patients with STS at a high risk of distant relapse. Therefore, the goal of this clinical trial is to investigate whether hypofractionated RT combined with a sequential chemotherapyï¼ˆAI regimensï¼‰can enhance short-term treatment efficacy for extremity STS patients without compromising local control rates and increasing related toxicities"

NCT06593080,The DECIDE-TB Trial; Validation of Treatment Decision Algorithms for Childhood Tuberculosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06593080,"The Decide-TB project aims to generate evidence for the implementation of a comprehensive Treatment Decision Algorithms (TDA) based approach for TB in children living in high TB burden and resource-limited countries, at District Hospital (DH) and Primary Health Centre (PHC) levels, and to facilitate the integration of this evidence within practices and policies.

This programmatic pilot led by the National TB Programs (NTP) will test a TDA-based approach integrating TB screening, diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and disease severity assessment for shorter treatment eligibility, for use at a lower level of healthcare. This TDA-based approach will be evaluated in a hybrid effectiveness implementation study based on a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial. The Decide TB project will be implemented at the district level, targeting five districts in each country. Each cluster in a district will be made up of one district hospital and six primary health centers. The study will develop a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to operationalize the use of TDAs, and strengthen District Health Information Systems (DHIS2) to collect individual data, which will contribute to monitoring and evaluation, clinical mentoring, and supervision by the country's NTPs."

NCT06593041,ROLE of PLATELETS in the PATHOPHYSIOLOGY of SYSTEMIC LUPUS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06593041,"Blood platelets, well known for their role in hemostasis, are abnormally activated in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but also from other immunomediated diseases (scleroderma, vasculitis, myositis, Gougerot-SjÃ¶gren's and rheumatoid arthritis) in cases of high disease activity. Once activated, platelets express adhesion molecules such as P-selectin on their surface, enabling them to interact physically with immune cells. In a recent work, we identified that activated platelets from lupus patients interact with regulatory T cells and block their regulatory function, thus participating in the deregulated activation of the immune system in SLE. In addition, inhibition of platelet-immune cell interactions by an anti-P-selectin antibody improved LES symptoms in two mouse models.

The aim of this work is to investigate other potential platelet-immune cell interactions in patients with SLE, in comparison with other autoimmune diseases (systemic scleroderma, ANCA vasculitides, inflammatory myositis, Gougerot-SjÃ¶gren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis).

This study could lead to a better understanding of the role of platelets in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, identify new biomarkers of activity, and assess the potential of new therapeutic avenues in these diseases, such as platelet targeting."

NCT06592573,Online or In-person Interventions on Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Caregivers of Patients with Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06592573,"Oncological diseases are considered a family disease because when one member is diagnosed with cancer, the psycho-physical, social and economic consequences affect the entire family. In Italy, approximately 17% of the population assists a family member. These caregivers are typically unpaid individuals such as partners, offspring, and relatives who provide daily support. In Italy, the prevalence of depressive disorders among caregivers of patients with cancer ranges between 40%-70%. Therefore, providing psychological support to patients and their caregivers throughout the illness and beyond is essential. This support should include the assistance of psychologists and psychotherapists experienced in coping with illness and grieving. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) refers to a series of interventions aimed at treating psychological disorders by modifying dysfunctional cognitive factors that sustain and exacerbate this condition. In the telemedicine setting, psychological teleconsultation is experiencing extensive development, especially in the home setting for chronic illnesses. According to the scientific literature, much evidence suggests no difference in the effectiveness of psychological therapies provided telematically or in-person.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of CBT online or in-person intervention on anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention is designed for caregivers of patients with cancer assisted at home. The sample population consists of caregivers of patients assisted by the oncological palliative home care programme of ANT Foundation and caregivers grieving for a loved one previously assisted by ANT Foundation.

Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised into two groups:

Online group: caregivers will receive an intervention of 10-12 psychological sessions in the online setting.

In-person group: caregivers will receive the same CBT intervention lasting 10-12 psychological sessions, in-person.

We are expecting:

* Reduction in anxiety symptoms measured by comparison of the results obtained at T0 and T1 of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire
* Reduction in depressive symptoms measured by comparing the results obtained at T0 and T1 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) questionnaire."

NCT06591962,The Comparison of Biopsychosocial Characteristics with and Without Diabetes Mellitus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06591962,"As it is a chronic disease, the lifelong disease duration and treatment process affect individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) biologically, psychologically, and socially by causing them to experience fatigue, increased stress, and life burden. Individuals with T2DM experience many psychosocial conditions leading to anxiety and depression as well as physical and functional effects. It has been reported that the fear of diabetic complications plays a vital role in depression, while individuals with diabetes with anxiety are more prone to depression. In addition, increased treatment cost burden has been reported among the psychological factors contributing to anxiety and depression in individuals with DM. One study reported that fatigue is commonly associated with increased anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in individuals with DM. A sedentary lifestyle in these individuals is noteworthy and has also been shown to be a contributing factor to depression.

In addition to improving diabetic complications due to the disease, reducing depressive states and improving the psychosocial status of individuals may positively affect diabetes and reduce the symptoms and complications of T2DM. It has also been reported that increasing the self-efficacy of individuals with diabetes may positively impact the treatment. Based on this information, it is clear that there is a need for physical and psychosocial evaluation of individuals with T2DM in disease management. Therefore, determination of the biopsychosocial effects of individuals with T2DM in improving disease-specific findings and quality of life of individuals with T2DM to reflect positively on disease management processes is necessary for holistic management in treating these individuals. However, studies in this field are insufficient. This study aimed to compare individuals with and without T2DM biopsychosocial characteristics.

The BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire, which assesses the biopsychosocial status of individuals with rheumatism, has no validity in individuals with T2DM. Since the patient population and other scales to be used are common, it was considered to carry out the validity, reliability, and responsiveness study of this scale within the scope of this study."

It participates in central metabolic activities to maintain systemic homeostasis. It is also one of the most vulnerable organs in the process of individual aging. During aging, the volume, blood flow, metabolic capacity and regenerative capacity of the liver decrease. Liver function changes with age can lead to age-related systemic susceptibility diseases.

Therefore, understanding the changes of metabolism and immune function in the process of liver aging and studying the regulation mechanism of liver aging will provide an important reference for understanding the causes of increased susceptibility to liver-related diseases in the elderly population.On the other hand, gender factors also affect organ function, leading to differences in human aging and disease outcomes.At present, the omics research on liver aging is mainly based on tissue-level transcription, protein or metabolomics, and most of the conclusions are focused on hepatocytes. However, for other cell types and microenvironment interactions, people know little about the aging changes at the cellular levelBased on the current research status, this study aims to explore the gender differences in the process of liver aging, using emerging technologies such as the combination of single-cell multi-omics and spatial localization, to reveal the factors driving liver aging from a gender perspective, and to promote the development of accurate interventions for aging and aging-related diseases."

NCT06591702,"Investigation of the Validity, Reliability, and Responsiveness of BETY-BQ in Chronic Kidney Disease, on Dialysis, and Kidney Transplantation",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06591702,"A review of the literature has shown that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is strongly associated with an increasing degree of psychosocial impact, such as depression and anxiety and a decrease in quality of life. Therefore, while determining the psychosocial aspects of the disease gains importance, it is reported that determining and evaluating the biopsychosocial characteristics may facilitate the disease management of individuals. Considering that CKD is associated with various comorbidities, psychosocial features, and symptom burden, it is interpreted that patient-reported outcome measures may support the complex management of these individuals. Routine collection and use of patient-reported outcome measures may provide valuable data for understanding the disease from both individual and community perspectives, with the potential to improve the quality of care and outcomes.

The Cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach (BiliÅŸsel Egzersiz Terapi YaklaÅŸÄ±mÄ±-BETY) is an innovative exercise model based on physical exercise and an example of a biopsychosocial approach developed for patients with rheumatism. The BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire (BETY-BQ) was created by repeated statistics of improvement characteristics reported by individuals who participated in BETY sessions for many years. The BETY-BQ holistically assesses many biopsychosocial characteristics of the person, such as pain, functionality, mood, sociability, sexuality, and sleep. Therefore, there is a need for scales that assess these symptoms holistically in chronic kidney disease. BETY-BQ can be envisaged as an assessment tool for interdisciplinary healthcare team members who want to evaluate the CKD population, including individuals on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. Since the BETY-BQ can assess biopsychosocial characteristics quickly and its structure was created with the feedback of individuals with chronic diseases, it aimed to examine its validation in this disease group.

In this study, which investigators planned to contribute to this field, investigators aimed to investigate the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of BETY-BQ in individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and kidney transplantation."

NCT06591260,Role of Endomyocardial Biopsy and Aetiology-based Treatment in Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Heart Disease in Arrhythmic and Non-arrhythmic Clinical Presentations: an Integrated Approach for the Optimal Diagnostic and Therapeutic Management (MYOPED),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06591260,"Myocarditis is a complex inflammatory disease, usually occurring secondary to viral infections, autoimmune processes or toxic agents. Clinical presentations are multiple, including chest-pain, heart failure and a broad spectrum of arrhythmias. In turn, outcome is largely unpredictable, ranging from mild self-limiting disease, to chronic stage and progressive evolution towards dilated cardiomyopathy, to rapid adverse outcome in fulminant forms. Subsequently, myocarditis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, and optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are still to be defined. This study, both retrospective and prospective, originally single-center and subsequently upgraded to multicenter, aims at answering multiple questions about myocarditis, with special attention to its arrhythmic manifestations.

Optimal diagnostic workflow is still to be defined. In fact, although endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is still the diagnostic gold standard, especially for aetiology identification, it is an invasive technique. Furthermore, it may lack sensitivity because of sampling errors. By converse, modern imaging techniques - cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in particular - have been proposed as alternative or complementary diagnostic tool in inflammatory heart disease. Other noninvasive diagnostic techniques, like delayed-enhanced CT (DECT) scan or position emission tomography (PET) scan, are under investigation.

Biomarkers to identify myocarditis aetiology, predisposition, prognosis and response to treatment are still to be defined.

Arrhythmic myocarditis is largely underdiagnosed and uninvestigated. Importantly, myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias requires specific diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic considerations. At the group leader hospital, which is an international referral center for ventricular arrhythmias management and ablation, a relevant number of patients with unexplained arrhythmias had myocarditis as underlying aetiology. The experience of a dedicated third-level center is going to be shared with other centers, to considerably improve knowledge and management of arrhythmic myocarditis.

The role of CMR, as well as alternative noninvasive imaging techniques, in defining myocarditis healing is a relevant issue. In particular, optimal timing for follow-up diagnostic reassessment is still to be defined, in patients with myocarditis at different inflammatory stages, either with or without aetiology-dependent treatment.

Uniformly-designed studies are lacking, to compare myocarditis among different patient subgroups, differing by variables like: clinical presentations, myocarditis stage, associated cardiac or extra-cardiac diseases, aetiology-based treatment, associated arrhythmic manifestations, diagnostic workup, and devices or ablation treatment."

NCT06590948,Clinical Application of Quantitative Major Imaging Features of CEUS LI-RADS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590948,"Liver cancer (LC) is the sixth most common malignant tumor and the third cause of cancer mortality in the world. According to the 2018 United States Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, patients with HCC high-risk factors can be directly diagnosed by imaging if they have typical imaging signs, without the need for puncture pathological confirmation.

Since 2011, United States the American College of Radiology (ACR) has successively launched Liver Imaging And Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) based-on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI), and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) , which have achieved good clinical diagnostic results and are constantly being updated and improved.LI-RADS provides standardized imaging diagnosis for high-risk populations and classifies each liver lesion into LR-1 to LR-5 (possibility of HCC), LR-M (probably or definitely malignant, but not HCC), LR-TIV (intravenous tumor).

Although CEUS LR-5 has a high accuracy in diagnosing HCC, there is also a considerable proportion of HCC in CEUS LR-4 and CEUS LR-3. Studies have shown that CEUS LR-M contains a high proportion of HCC, the sensitivity of CEUS LR-5 in diagnosing HCC is relatively low, and the possibility of HCC cannot be ruled out if it is not classified as CEUS LR-5. Therefore, how to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is the key goal of CEUS LI-RADS.

According to the CEUS LI-RADS diagnostic criteria, the key signs include arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE) and washout. The guidelines divide washout into an early and late washout with 60 seconds after contrast agent injection. If the lesion present with a completely ""black hole"" within 2 minutes, it is classified as marked washout, otherwise it is mild washout. The current judgment of the degree of washout is based on the subjective decision made by the observer subjectively, which cannot distinguish the subtle differences in the image and has a subjective dependence. The consistency among the observers is uneven, which affects the diagnostic efficiency of CEUS LI-RADS. Based on this, the purpose of this study was to quantify the key parameters of CEUS LI-RADS: Washout Onset and Washout Degree, and propose standardized and objective diagnostic criteria, to reduce the differences between observers and further improve its diagnostic sensitivity for high-risk groups of HCC."

NCT06590766,Impact of Acupuncture and Manual Therapies on Patients' Quality-of-life in a Hospital-to-community Continuum,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590766,"Oncology patients often suffer during hospitalization from pain, emotional distress, gastrointestinal symptoms, weakness, and quality of life (QoL)-related concerns. A large body of research has shown that acupuncture and other integrative oncology (IO) modalities, when provided in conjunction with supportive care, can significantly address and alleviate QoL-related concerns. In the proposed study, we examine an innovative model of IO and palliative care, provided to patients with cancer during hospitalization. Oncology patients at the Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, will be referred by hospital to IO/palliative care, specifying the patient's QoL-related concerns. After signing the informed consent form, patients will be asked to choose between IO intervention (Group A and B) or palliative nursing counseling only (Group C). Patients choosing to undergo integrative treatment will be randomly allocated to one of the two study interventions: acupressure-relaxation alone (Group A); or acupressure-relaxation modalities with acupuncture (Group B). The response to the study intervention for QoL-related concerns will be re-assessed immediately; at 24-48 hours; and after 2 weeks following the treatment. Patients will also undergo objective measurements during treatment using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Nociception Levels (NOL) to determine the impact of the intervention on their QoL and concerns. In summary, the proposed study will examine the short-term impact of an integrative/palliative intervention on patient QoL-related concerns, comparing acupressure-relaxation modalities with or without acupuncture, as well as to patients receiving palliative nursing counseling. Following discharge, treatments will be provided at one of six participating community IO services, over a 12-week period, in coordination with the oncology and palliative care teams in the community."

NCT06590727,Psychological Well-being in Patients With Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590727,"Psychoncological evaluation in patients diagnosed with breast cancer is often limited to psychological distress and does not include evaluation of individual resources. This assessment could contribute to implement adherence to treatment protocols and eventual post traumatic growth. This study shows a new model of psychoncological triage by screening the risk of psychological distress and coping resources in patients with non metastatic breast cancer while waiting for surgery. The evaluation is performed at the hospital after the diagnosis and by means of psychological counseling and psychodiagnostic assessment (T0) with follow up interventions along the continuum of care.

Recruitment of the sample will take place in three different phases. It Includes time zero (T0) when patients are assessed during the pre-hospitalisation pathway. Time 1 (T1) patients are re-evaluated during the perioperative hospitalisation phase. Time 2 (T2) patients are re-evaluated after nine months at the end of treatment. As this phase is highly individualised for each patient and therefore susceptible to variation in duration and treatment modalities. Online psychometric revaluation will be possible. The link to the questionnaires will be sent to patients by e-mail and subsequently by telephone or in person contact.

Patients are evaluated by following questionnaires. Distress Thermometer (DT). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Mini Mental of Adjustment for Cancer Scale (MINIMac) and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Assessment (CORE OM) and Post Traumatic Growth Inventory

Cut off COREOM is From 10 to 15 Mild. From 15 to 20 Moderate. From 20 to 25 Mod or Severe. From 25 Severe. Scoring is from 0 is not at all and to 4 is very often/always. Reversed items 3.4. 7. 12. 19. 21. 31. 32. Higher scores correspond to greater problems.

The cut off of the distress thermometer is greater than 4. The cut off oh HADS is 7. From 0 to 7 is considered normal. A score of 8 or higher indicating probable presence of a mood disorder.

The miniMAC scale is a self-descriptive tool. The respondent on his or her own evaluates, using a four point scale to what extent a given statement applies to him or her at present. Each statement is rated on a scale of 1 (definitely not) to 4 (definitely yes), and the results available for each of the four strategies for dealing with the disease are 7-28 points. The higher the score, the greater the severity of the behaviors in the patient's struggle with cancer.

Post Traumatic Growth Inventory. Each of the 21 items falls under one of the five factors and are scored accordingly. A summation of the scores indicates the level of post-traumatic growth.

The advantage of this scale is that the categorization of scores according to the five factors are suggestive of which area of self-development is predominant in us and which area might be a little behind."

NCT06590584,Validity and Reliability of the 6-minute Pegboard Ring Test in Obese Individuals,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590584,"Obesity is a major public health problem that causes numerous diseases and problems that threaten human health. The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the last \~50 years and has reached pandemic levels. Similar results are seen in Turkey, and according to the results of the Turkey Health Survey, 20.2% of people aged 15 and over were obese and 35.6% were pre-obese in 2022. Obesity represents a major health problem as it significantly increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea and various cancers, thus contributing to a decrease in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus representing an increasing economic burden.

Obesity is associated with physiological changes at the muscle level, including a decrease in capillary density and blood flow, thus limiting the supply of oxygen and energy resources. Along with the limited blood flow, muscle cells in obese individuals have a decrease in the relative number and size of mitochondria required for energy supply. This leads to a limitation in upper limb activities.

This activity restriction is related to many activities of daily living that involve unsupported upper extremity movements that lead to dyspnea and fatigue in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. Therefore, determining the strength, endurance and exercise capacity of the upper extremities emerges as an important issue in obesity management. One of the tests that serve this purpose is the 6-minute pegboard ring test (6PBRT), which has been found to be valid and reliable in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, when the literature is examined, it is seen that 6PBRT has not been studied in obese individuals. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the validity and reliability of 6PBRT in obese individuals.

The main question it aims to answer is:

- Is 6PBRT a valid and reliable method to assess upper extremity functional capacity in patients wit obesity?"

This can cause babies to die if left untreated treated. Currently the part of bowel that doesn't have normal nerves is removed with an operation, but this can have long-term complications including needing a permanent bag on the tummy for poo (stoma). Because of this there is an urgent need for better treatments.

The investigators have found that children with HSCR have nerve stem cells throughout their bowel, even in the lower end where the nerves haven't grown normally. We can grow these stem cells in the laboratory to form balls of nerve cells (neurospheres). The investigators want to find out whether these neurospheres grow into the nerves that are needed for the bowel to work normally. First the investigators will see how the nerve stem cells from the lower end of the bowel grow compared to those from the normal bowel. Then the investigators will see if the neurospheres change when the investigators put them with medications that affect growth of bowel nerves.

At the end of this project the investigators hope to know whether the nerve stem cells at the lower part of the bowel in children with HSCR can turn into bowel nerve cells that might make the bowel work normally. The investigators also hope to know whether the investigators can use medications to make the stem cells turn into normal nerves, meaning that children with HSCR could avoid an operation and a stoma."

NCT06590025,Study the Efficacy and Safety of the INtegral Cognitive REMediation Program (INCREM) for Depression,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590025,"Feeling sad about negative or stressful events has nothing to do with the diagnosis of depression, as this is a very prevalent mental illness among the population with devastating consequences for the person suffering from it. Symptoms range from mood swings, extreme sadness, apathy, inability to feel pleasure, to sleep problems, eating disorders, physical problems, and more. Other very common but little-known symptoms are those that affect memory, concentration, and the ability to organize and solve problems.

Recent scientific findings have shown that these symptoms, called cognitive symptoms, are the most interfering with day-to-day life, even when other mental symptoms begin to improve or have resolved. Cognitive symptoms are associated with work difficulties, especially in terms of productivity or a decrease in social relationships to the point of isolation, thus interfering with the full recovery from depression. Studies have estimated that the economic and social costs not related to the health costs of depression can be more than 90 million euros per year. The fact that cognitive symptoms are not explored during clinical interviews means that they are not treated adequately, and professionals usually wait for cognitive difficulties to be resolved with the available antidepressant treatments. But more than 30% of people with depression are unable to return to work, and up to 45% of patients are on sick leave a year later, although mood symptoms have often been ameliorated.

This opens a new line of research worldwide that aims to find effective treatments for the cognitive symptoms of depression. Some drugs have been developed and cognitive training programs designed for patients with dementia or neurological conditions have been tested, but the results are not convincing enough because there is no transfer of cognitive improvements into people\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s lives. The research team of this proposal designed a comprehensive rehabilitation program for cognition and daily functioning for depression, taking into account the specific cognitive symptoms, and the real difficulties that patients face. Thus was born INCREM (INtegral Cognitive REMediation for Depression), which includes cognitive training and therapy sessions focused on the rehabilitation of daily functioning. The first results in very selected samples have shown an objective improvement in day-to-day functioning, not only after the intervention but up to 6 months later. The aim of this proposal is to demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of INCREM for depression in a larger and more diverse sample of patients, as well as finding out the effects of INCREM on the brain. The ultimate goal is to implement this type of therapy in mental health care centers in order to treat patients\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; cognitive symptoms and get them back to their personal, work and social lives."

Take either Tertinat or a placebo daily for a duration of 24 months. Visit the clinic once a year for check-ups and testing."
NCT06589999,Detection of Spinal Cord Lesions Using the MP2RAGE Sequence in Inflammatory Diseases of the Neuraxis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06589999,"Since the last revision of the MRI guidelines in multiple sclerosis (MS, MAGNIMS) and the McDonald criteria in 2017, all spinal cord lesions must be counted to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of MS. Focal lesions of the spinal cord are more frequently located in the cervical segments than in the lower segments of the spinal cord and occupy the lateral and posterior columns, although the central grey matter may not be spared. Cervical involvement is difficult to study because of the small size of the lesions and the loss of signal in the cervical region. As a result, the detection of cervical lesions on MRI is sub-optimal.

In this context, standardised acquisition protocols have been proposed.

For MRI of the spinal cord, at least two of the following sagittal sequences are recommended: T2, STIR, double inversion recovery, T1 with gadolinium injection, and/or T2 axial acquisitions.

Recently, our team validated the superiority of 3D PSIR and 3D FGAPSIR sequences, which offer better detection performance than T2 and STIR on 3 Tesla MRI.

Other studies have also shown the contribution of the MP2RAGE sequence to the detection of spinal cord lesions in MS, compared with the set of sequences classically recommended. The MP2RAGE sequence is a T1 sequence, which creates a composite image, limiting field inhomogeneity bias while providing a quantitative T1 map.

NCT06589544,Non-pharmacological Care for Depression in Cancer Patients Using VR and TMS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06589544,"Despite its significant impact on individuals and healthcare systems, substantial gaps remain in the clinical and rehabilitative management of depression in oncology patients.

Depression in cancer patients is often under-recognized and untreated, and screening tools and structured healthcare pathways are lacking. Even when depression is identified in oncology patients, evidence of effective treatments is limited. There are no specific guidelines for psychotropic drug use in cancer patients, and antidepressant efficacy is uncertain despite their frequent use.

Emerging strategies like transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive rehabilitation show promising findings. However, the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic strategies is understudied.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is already used for the treatment and relapse prevention of depression both as monotherapy and as an add-on to antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and it appears effective in improving cognitive performance. However, it has not yet been applied to treat depressive disorders in oncology patients.

Virtual reality-based cognitive behavioral intervention (VR-COG) is designed to improve cognitive functioning, a central feature of depression in oncological conditions. VR-COG enhances learning and skill acquisition with better ecological efficiency than traditional cognitive remediation programs. VR approaches are well-received by oncology patients and show promise in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms.

The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of highly specialized, nonpharmacological interventions on depressive symptoms and quality of life in oncology patients. Specifically, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Virtual Reality-based Cognitive Remediation (VR-COG) will be analyzed, alongside standard Treatment as Usual (TAU), in comparison to TAU alone. This trial also aims at evaluate cognitive functioning, depression-related conditions and the cost-effectiveness of the interventions under study."

However, the residual nucleus pulposus may protrude again after extraction, and the stability of the operative segment decreases and the degeneration of the diseased segment accelerates. Therefore, while decompression of nerve root is completed under total endoscopic nucleus pulposus extraction, tissue engineering of nucleus pulposus is urgently needed to replace the lost part, repair the remaining nucleus pulposus, and enable the disc to be re-sealed and pressurized. Nucleus pulposus tissue engineering is mainly based on cell therapy, and the corresponding biological scaffolds are selected to transplant cells into the diseased area for treatment. However, the current nuclear tissue engineering has some shortcomings, such as limited seed cell source, difficult survival of seed cells, inflammatory rejection in the transplantation area, poor mechanical properties of biological scaffolds, poor degradation performance, and inability to produce biospecific reactions between materials and cells, which seriously restrict the clinical application of nuclear tissue engineering. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are ideal seed cells for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation due to their wide availability, strong proliferation ability and good immune regulation. Therefore, in this project, hUC-MSCs are used for cell transplantation into the vertebral disc of diseased vertebrae. As the treatment method of this project is extremely minimally invasive, it is conducive to the widespread promotion of the technology."

OA is featured by mechanical articular pain, crackling and short post-immobilization stiffness. OA pain has variable pathophysiology, and despite many pharmacological options available, its treatment is often ineffective and presents significant side effects. On this way, the search for more effective and safer treatments is paramount on the OA field. Among potential treatments are the Cannabis-derived substances. Cannabis plants have been used for diverse purposes by mankind over thousands of years. Its best-known species, Cannabis sativa, has more than a hundred substances called cannabinoids, or more specifically phytocannabinoids, the most important of which are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These two phytocannabinoids display a number of pharmacological effects when used together or in isolation. Although many preclinical studies indicate usefulness of phytocannabinoids, currently the clinical evidence for its application is still scarce.

NCT06588751,Effects of SCALP Block on Postoperative Analgesia in Craniotomy Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06588751,"Patients undergoing craniotomy surgery often experience severe postoperative pain. This pain can affect the patient's hemodynamics, disrupt sleep patterns, and prolong hospital stays. Sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure due to pain may lead to elevated intracranial pressure in patients, potentially causing morbidity and mortality. Opioids are commonly used to mitigate hemodynamic fluctuations and reduce postoperative pain; however, they may delay recovery, contribute to excessive sedation, and affect postoperative neurological examinations. Additionally, opioids have adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. Alleviating hemodynamic instability and postoperative pain are critical concerns for neuro anesthesiologists. Regional analgesia techniques are employed in neurosurgery patients because they minimize anesthesia requirements, alleviate pain, and allow for neurological assessment with a lower incidence of systemic complications.The scalp block was developed due to its potential benefits as an effective regional anesthesia technique that supports the advancement of delicate brain surgeries such as functional and microsurgeries."

By collecting tissue when a patient has active inflammation, it is possible to determine which T cells are activated and undergoing clonal expansion in the patient's diseased organ. TScan has developed a genome-wide, high-throughput technology to determine the natural, physiological target of any TCR (Kula, 2019). The goal of this study is to isolate T cells from inflamed tissues and matched blood samples and/or matched normal tissues (for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases). T cell clones that are expanded in diseased tissues relative to blood or normal tissues will be selected and the targets of their TCRs will be defined using TScan's genome-wide, high-throughput target ID technology.

The goal of this study is to discover a collection of peptide targets, along with their associated TCRs to be developed as new tolerogenic therapies for patients with autoimmune diseases."

NCT06587750,Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation for CRPS Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06587750,"Pain treatment for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is challenging. There is some evidence that pain can be reduced by therapies aimed at helping patients 'find' normal sensation in the painful body part (i.e. perceiving the exact location of a touch on the painful hand with eyes closed). In this study, a collaboration between the CRPS service at Royal United Hospital (RUH), University of the West of England (UWE), University of Bath (UoB) and Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation Center, the investigators aim to test whether it is possible to administer a treatment called Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation (CMR) to people with CRPS. In order to do this, treatment-partners (e.g. spouses, partners) will be trained to deliver CMR in a home-based environment under the supervision of a CMR specialist. Generally speaking, CMR is a rehabilitation technique in which patients are guided to better feel their painful limb by paying more attention to different sensations (e.g. touch, or position), and mindfully moving it. Since previously CMR has shown promising results in people with stroke, the investigators believe that this method could be very useful for treating pain in CRPS."
NCT06587724,"Investigation of the Validity, Reliability, and Responsiveness of the BETY-BQ in Myositis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06587724,"Individuals diagnosed with myositis have skin, joint, and visceral organ involvement together with proximal muscle weakness, impaired physical function, sexual function, and quality of life also affect individuals psychosocially. Increased anxiety-depression-anxiety problems are observed in individuals, and many factors contributing to these conditions are reported. Therefore, while holistic evaluation of individuals, including these factors, gains importance, more information on how the quality of life changes during the disease is required. There is a need for tools to evaluate these characteristics in individuals disease management and treatment process.

The cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach (BiliÅŸsel Egzersiz Terapi YaklaÅŸÄ±mÄ±-BETY) is an innovative exercise model based on physical exercise and an example of a biopsychosocial approach developed in patients with rheumatism. The BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire (BETY-BQ) was created by repeated statistics of the improvement characteristics reported by individuals who participated in BETY sessions for many years. The BETY-BQ holistically evaluates many biopsychosocial characteristics of the individual, such as pain, coping skills, functionality, mood, sociability, sexuality, and sleep. Therefore, there is a need for scales that holistically evaluate the symptoms mentioned in myositis disease. Since the BETY-BQ can assess biopsychosocial characteristics quickly and its structure was created with the feedback of individuals with chronic disease, it aimed to examine its validation in this disease group.

This study, which the investigators planned to contribute to this field, aims to investigate BETY-BQ\^s validity, reliability, and responsiveness in individuals diagnosed with myositis."

NCT06587646,VirtuAl Technology to Improve the Management of Perianal Crohn&#39;s (VAMP) - PROSPECTIVE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06587646,"Crohn's is an inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the gut. Over half a million people in the UK live with Crohn's disease and about a quarter will develop a fistula near their back passage. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two surfaces of the body. These can be hard to treat causing pain and infection. Surgery is required to control infection and in extreme cases this can lead to incontinence or even formation of a stoma, when the bowel is brought to the skin and waste goes into a bag on the tummy wall.

Patients with perianal Crohn's are usually referred to a surgeon by their medical team and subsequently undergo a MRI scan and an examination under anaesthesia (EUA) where abscesses (regions of fluid build-up) will be drained and a seton (plastic sling or suture) inserted through the fistula, or the fistula opened to the skin if this will not affect continence. They are then started on specialist medication by the gastroenterologists (gut doctors).

Abscesses or fistulas can be difficult to identify during EUA, leading to ongoing infection and repeat procedures. This causes additional scarring and delays the medical treatment that can allow fistulas to heal. Multiple or incorrectly performed operations can also damage the muscles that help hold stool in the back passage, leading to incontinence.

We believe that improving how information is communicated between radiology (who report scans) and surgeons will improve their ability to identify and manage all fistulas and collections at operation. Here is a typical MRI report given to the surgeon by the radiologist:

\&#39;There is a low intersphincteric fistula with predicted internal opening in the lower half of the anal canal at dentate line level between 5-6 o'clock that passes in the intersphincteric plane to the anal verge between 5-6 o\&#39;clock.\&#39;

This protocol was developed in an era when written communication was really the only way to convey information between specialists. Jargon aside, surgeons face significant difficulty interpreting such written descriptions of a complex 3D structure and using it as a surgical guide. Indeed, a major complaint from surgeons is how difficult it is to get real value from these preoperative MRIs, which cost time and money.

With advances in digital technology, we believe this system can be vastly improved.

Motilent (a UK SME specialising in technology to improve the management of Crohn\&amp;#39;s Disease) has developed a sophisticated visualisation tool to provide a 3D model of the fistula and surrounding structures, we call this tool Virtual EUA (vEUA), allowing the surgeon to better understand the anatomy of the problem in conjunction with radiology.

We are aiming to establish whether vEUA changes the behaviour of colorectal surgeons, increasing confidence in identifying and dealing with fistulas, which will reduce the number of surgical procedures required and improve the quality of care, resulting in a cost saving for the hospital and a much-needed step towards more effective management of perianal Crohn\&#39;s.

Any patient taking part in the trial will be randomly allocated to have the 3D model utilised in their care or standard care. We will use pre- and post-surgical patient questionnaires, surgical questionnaires and MRI imaging to establish if vEUA is safe and effective in improving the care of patients with perianal Crohn\&#39;s."

NCT06587217,Neurobiological Drivers of Mobility Resilience: The Dopaminergic System - Supplemental Open-Label Arm,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06587217,"Walking with age becomes both slower and less 'automated', requiring more attention and brain resources. As a result, older adults have a greater risk of negative outcomes and falls. There is an urgent need to identify factors that can help compensate for these harmful factors and reduce walking impairments, as there are currently no effective treatments available. Investigators have recently discovered that \~20% of older adults maintain fast walking speed even in the presence of small blood vessel brain changes and leg problems, thus appearing to be protected against these harmful factors. The investigators work suggests that the brain dopamine (DA) system may be a source of this protective capacity. Investigators have also shown that lower levels of dopamine are associated with slow walking. Investigators will be investigating the role of dopamine on slow walking and other parkinsonian signs in this open-label study using detailed clinical assessment, assessment of dopamine activity, and clinical interventions."

NCT06587126,Feasibility of Cough Monitoring in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06587126,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by chronic airway infection and impaired mucociliary clearance, which predisposes those affected to recurrent pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and progressive decline in lung function. Treatment with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) results in decreases in patient-reported cough and PEx. Despite this, increased cough remains the most common symptom associated with acute PEx and worsening lung disease. Cough frequency was historically difficult to measure due to reliance on human input. Recent advances in audio capture and signal processing have made automated cough detection possible. As a result there's been a surge in development of portable cough monitors, as cough is increasingly recognized as a measurable parameter of respiratory disease. The majority of cough monitors have been designed for use in adults, and little is known about the practicality of collecting cough data in the pediatric population. In this study investigators aim to assess the feasibility of using an in-home device to capture nighttime cough frequency in children with and without CF. Investigators plan to compare nighttime cough frequency between children with and without CF and, among children with CF, and determine the association between cough frequency and baseline lung function. Additionally, investigators aim to evaluate the changes in nighttime cough frequency in relationship to respiratory symptom scores surrounding clinician diagnosed pulmonary exacerbations. This study will provide important preliminary data needed for a larger study assessing the utility of home cough monitoring for clinical care and for use of cough as a clinical outcome measure in research studies."

* How safe is ESK-001 in people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis?

The study includes 2 comparators: a placebo control (a 'dummy' tablet that does not contain the medicine ESK-001 but looks just like it) and an active control (apremilast, which is a medicine approved to treat psoriasis).

People taking part in this study must be men or women aged at least 18 years and have had plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months, currently moderate to severe.

Participants will:

* take drug every day for 24 weeks.
* visit the clinic for checkups and tests.
* fill out questionnaires about their psoriasis, itch severity, and change in quality of life.
* be assessed for health issues and side effects, physical examinations, vital signs, heart electrical activity measurements, and psychological health.
* provide blood and urine samples."

PLAQUA-Study",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06585930,"The goal of this study is to determine whether the Platelet Clot Stiffness (PCS) measured by QUANTRAÂ® is predictive of an abnormality in primary haemostasis intraoperatively in cardiac surgery performed under extracorporeal circulation.

The aim is to compare the assessment of platelet function by QUANTRAÂ® (data called PCS, obtained in around ten minutes) with laboratory tests which are validated, but which cannot be used in current practice (response time too long, in particular). We are therefore seeking to determine whether QUANTRA is reliable in the search for a primary hemostasis anomaly, defined by significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100G/L), and/or a prolongation of platelet occlusion time measured by PFA-200Â® (normal or increased).

This clinical research project will last 12 months. It will take place in the cardiac surgery operating room at CHU FÃ©lix Guyon, and will involve 100 patients.

Patients who have consented to participate in this research project will be managed in the operating room in the usual way, with no change to their usual care (in terms of treatments received). At the end of the surgery, we will add 3 blood samples (maximum 8.1ml) for analysis to assess platelet function and compare with QUANTRA data.

This blood sample will be the only procedure performed. Medical management remains standard and will not be disrupted by this test."

Nonetheless, excessive fluid administration can lead to fluid overload which has been associated with worse outcomes in the ICU. To prevent this, assessments of fluid responsiveness are commonly employed. However, fluid responsiveness does not take fluid tolerance into account. Fluid tolerance is the idea that a patient might still be fluid responsive but might already be at risk of the detrimental effects of fluid therapy. Recent developments in point of care ultrasound e.g. the Venous excess ultrasound might help identify patients at risk of fluid overload. However its association with patient relevant outcomes in the ICU remains unclear."

This fact contributes strongly to the increased risk of aspiration pneumonia as a primary cause of death in people with HD. But regularly objective monitoring of the airway system condition is in common clinical practice almost impossible for high time requirements and the need for specialized expensive devices . This drives the need for a simpler and more cost-effective screening tool.

NCT06585306,High-flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy in Obese Patients Undergoing Sedative Gastroscopy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06585306,"Obese patients often have fat accumulation in the head and neck, increased soft tissue in the oropharynx, decreased lung compliance, decreased lung volume and residual volume, and some obese patients also suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, obese patients may experience hypoxemia during sedative gastroscopy. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) can provide patients with high-flow (20-70 L/min) and adjustable oxygen concentration (21%-100%) through a special nasal prong catheter. It has the function of warming and humidifying the air, relieving pressure on the nasal mucosa, maintaining airway patency and moisture, reducing the risk of nasal bleeding. In addition, HFNC can generate positive airway pressure (3-7 cmH2O), increase end-expiratory volume, help with alveolar recruitment, prevent atelectasis, and reduce shunts. The flow rate of HFNC is positively correlated with the nasopharyngeal pressure. At a flow rate of 50 L/min, the nasopharyngeal pressure can exceed 3 cmH2O. Obese patients are prone to upper airway obstruction under sedation or anesthesia. The use of HFNC at 70 L/min perioperatively can reduce hypoxemia in patients, but discomfort in the nasopharynx may occur at this flow rate. The optimal flow rate for clinical use of HFNC has not been established. Meta-analysis shows that when the oxygen flow rate during painless esophagogastroduodenoscopy is greater than 30 L/min, it can significantly reduce the incidence of hypoxemia in patients. Therefore, for obese patients undergoing painless esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the investigators propose using HFNC at three different flow rates: 30 L/min, 50 L/min, and 70 L/min, to provide guidance on the optimal flow rate for clinical use of HFNC."

NCT06585228,Detecting Cardiac Thrombi in Acute Ischemic Stroke on Cardiac CT Versus Transoesophageal Echocardiography,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06585228,"Rationale:

Cardiac CT acquired during the acute stroke imaging protocol (acute cardiac CT) has recently been shown to have a superior diagnostic yield than transthoracic echocardiography, which is currently the most commonly used method to screen for structural sources of cardioembolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The most common finding on acute cardiac CT are cardiac thrombi located in the left atrium (LA) and specifically the left atrial appendage (LAA). The higher diagnostic yield of acute cardiac CT compared to TTE is partially explained because CT allows for better visualization of the LAA, but also because cardiac thrombi may dissolve in the first days after stroke. Whether acute cardiac CT is the optimal diagnostic modality for LA thrombi in stroke patients is unknown, since data comparing it to transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is the reference standard to detect LA thrombi, are lacking. The general hypothesis of this study is that acute cardiac CT is the optimal method to detect LA thrombi in ischemic stroke patients, since TEE can miss LA thrombi that dissolve in the first days after stroke.

Objectives:

1. Determine whether acute cardiac CT has a higher diagnostic probability of detecting LA thrombi compared to TEE or repeated cardiac CT in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke by assessing the rate at which LA thrombi dissolve in the first days after ischemic stroke occurrence.
2. Determine the positive predictive value of acute cardiac CT compared to TEE for the detection of LA thrombi. Study design: Prospective, single-centre, observational cohort Study population: 39 patients of 18 years or older with acute ischemic stroke and a LA thrombus detected on cardiac CT acquired during the acute stroke imaging.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

1. Rate at which LA thrombi visualized on acute cardiac CT dissolve in the first days after ischemic stroke.
2. False-positive rate for detection of left atrial thrombi on acute cardiac CT compared to TEE. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Clinical and imaging patient data which are obtained as part of standard care will be prospectively collected after written informed consent. Patient with a LA thrombus on acute cardiac CT will undergo TEE for research purposes after obtaining written informed consent. TEE is semi-invasive and associated with a small risk of major complications (\<0.2%). Patients will also be exposed to additional radiation (1.4 mSV) due to sequential cardiac CT after TEE. The Radiation Dose Committee deemed this to be an intermediate risk. In a small minority of patients (\<10%), another cardiac CT will be acquired 2 minutes after this sequential cardiac CT to ensure a clear, final assessment of the presence of an atrial appendage thrombus. This will result in a total additional radiation of 3 mSV for the two additional cardiac CT's. The Radiation Dose Committee deemed this to be an intermediate risk. As part of standard care, patients will be contacted for follow-up evaluation by a trained stroke nurse at 90 days. As a result of ischemic stroke, some patients become incapacitated to an extent they are unable to give informed consent. In these cases, the legal representative will be asked for informed consent. Decreased leveI of consciousness or aphasia are typical clinical characteristics of cardioembolic stroke. Therefore, it is pivotal to also include incapacitated acute ischemic stroke patients. Excluding these patients from the study would render the study non-representative of the study's target population (acute ischemic stroke patients with cardioembolic stroke due to LA thrombus)."

NCT06584851,3D-Microscopic Muscle Architecture in Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06584851,"The focus of this study is to understand and define the mechanisms of the altered muscle development and growth on a microscopic level within a long-term perspective in children with cerebral palsy and to relate these findings to muscle macroscopic properties defined by muscle imaging, to neuromuscular symptoms and to treatment.

This study aims to (1) evaluate intrinsic microscopic muscle properties of young growing children with CP, and (2) to evaluate these muscle properties in relation to macroscopic properties, neuromuscular symptoms and to treatment.

Improved understanding of changes in microscopic muscle properties, and how they relate to macroscopic properties and to the neuromuscular symptoms as well as how they are influenced by treatment, has the potential to delineate CP phenotypes prone to intervention and to optimize treatment protocols or develop new treatments, leading to new avenues for improving function in CP.

The method to study microscopic muscle properties involves analysis of muscle biopsies (histological / immunohistochemistry analysis, SC and IC culture, gene expression). Biopsies will be collected using the minimally invasive percutaneous needle microbiopsy technique, suitable for collecting repeated samples over time in the same individual while still leading to sufficient tissue of good quality for subsequent analysis1,2. For the children with CP, the local hospital's tradition of applying general anesthesia for delivering BTX injections will be exploited to collect the muscle samples prior to the BTX session and the one-year follow-up, or general anesthesia planned for orthopedic surgery or diagnostic imaging such as MRI, etc. For the collection of the samples 3 months before the BTX session, as well as 3 months and 6 months after BTX injections, the common approach for microbiospy collection will be applied, with local sedation on the skin (RapydanÂ©) and fascia (XylocaineÂ©) and local anesthesia by using KalinoxÂ© (nitrous oxide in oxygen) under supervision of the University Hospital PROSA team. Biopsies of TD muscles will be collected in children with no history of neurological disorder, nor musculoskeletal problems at the level of the gastrocnemius or semitendinosus, at the time of upper limb orthopedic or trauma surgery and thus always under general anesthesia. Ultrasound guided percutaneous muscle biopsy has been performed in children (2 months-18 years)3,4 and has proven to be safe and well-tolerated. A pilot study (S61110) was conducted to confirm that the microbiopsy technique is suitable for the analysis of microscopic muscle properties and is well-tolerated in children with CP.

NCT06584799,Venoactive Drug Treatment of Pelvic Venous Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06584799,"Venoactive drug (VAD) therapy is one of the most effective methods of treating chronic venous diseases (CVD). Numerous studies have proven its high efficacy in relieving symptoms of CVD, such as leg pain and swelling, leg heaviness and fatigue. Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) represent a group of pathological conditions including varicose veins of the pelvis and vulva, and compression stenoses of the left renal and common iliac veins. Although PeVDs are associated with venous lesions of the pelvis and retroperitoneum and have specific clinical manifestations, they are one of the forms of CVD and constitute a separate cohort. A number of studies on the VAD usage in PeVD indicate the wide possibilities of this type of treatment in eliminating chronic pelvic pain (CPP), the most dramatic symptom of PeVD, which is the main cause of disability and decreased quality of life, social and daily activity in women with PeVD. Currently, a variety of VADs are presented on the pharmaceutical market, which, according to the product labels, provide effects not only on the venous outflow from the lower extremities, but also on venous hemodynamics in the pelvis. At the same time, a literature analysis shows that micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) has the greatest evidence base obtained in the efficacy and safety studies of VADs in PeVD. Nevertheless, patients are rarely interested in the scientific dossier of drugs, and in the real practice the patients with PeVD and CPP most often ask: ""What is the best drug to use for the CPP relief?"" This is quite understandable, as it is CPP in PeVD that results not only in disability, but also in family conflicts, psycho-emotional stress and depressive states. In this regard, patients seek to get rid of pain as soon as possible and strive to use the most effective drug. An extensive scientific base of comparative studies on the use of various VADs in patients with CVD and PeVD has been accumulated to date. However, the literature is lack of any data on the comparative efficacy and safety of VADs in the treatment of patients with PeVD. This, in turn, makes not possible for doctors and patients to choose the optimal and most effective drug based on the objective research data. All the above has predetermined the purpose of the planned study as evaluating the efficacy and safety of different VADs in the treatment of female patients with PeVD."

NCT06584279,"Diagnostic Value of MRI-targeted Plus Index-lesion-ipsilaterally Systematic Biopsy for Biopsy-naive Men at Risk of Prostate Cancer: a Prospective, Multicenter, Paired, Non-inferiority Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06584279,"Targeted and systematic biopsy stands as the prevalent diagnostic approach for prostate cancer. Despite its widespread use, this method is characterized by a high volume of needle biopsies. A refined approach, termed targeted and index-lesion-ipsilateral systematic biopsy, as one of targeted and regional systematic biopsy methods, aim to reduce the number of biopsy cores while maintaining an adequate positive rate. However, the absence of robust evidence necessitates further investigation. This study employs a prospective, multicenter, paired, non-inferiority design to assess the diagnostic efficacy of targeted and index-lesion-ipsilateral systematic prostate biopsy in comparison with the conventional targeted and systematic biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Eligible participants were identified as those with target lesions on prostate MRI, who subsequently underwent targeted and systematic prostate biopsies. The index lesion was defined as the one with the highest Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score; in cases of multiple lesions with identical PI-RADS scores, the lesion with the greatest diameter was prioritized. Post-biopsy pathological data were collected and evaluated using the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system, which classifies patients with a grade of 2 or higher as having csPCa. The study's primary outcome was to calculate the confidence interval for the difference in csPCa detection rates between the two biopsy methods under a paired design. This interval was then compared against a pre-specified non-inferiority margin to determine whether the targeted and index-lesion-ipsilateral systematic biopsy method is non-inferior to the standard targeted and systematic biopsy in detecting csPCa."

NCT06584162,Subcutaneous Interval Lengthening of Vedolizumab for Economic Research,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06584162,"Rationale: Subcutaneous vedolizumab is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients using subcutaneous vedolizumab (every 2 weeks) have higher vedolizumab serum trough concentrations than those who are treated with intravenous vedolizumab (every 4-8 weeks). Since biologic therapies such as vedolizumab are expensive, lengthening of the injection interval (de-escalation) is of interest to reduce health care costs. However, maintaining remission while extending vedolizumab injection intervals has not been evaluated yet but represents a critical component of both medical and societal costs. Studies have suggested that higher vedolizumab serum concentrations are associated with superior clinical outcomes. Our strategy is to administer subcutaneous vedolizumab with prolonged intervals using therapeutic drug monitoring, i.e. dose based on vedolizumab concentrations, to reduce medical and societal costs while preserving remission.

Objectives: To evaluate whether subcutaneous vedolizumab therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided de-escalation will be cost-effective, compared to normal dosing regimen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission. The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy of TDM-guided de-escalation subcutaneous vedolizumab dosing compared to standard dosing.

Study design: This is a single-centre, randomized controlled, open-label pilot study.

Study population: 40 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) in steroid-free clinical and biochemical remission with subcutaneous vedolizumab maintenance therapy of 108 mg every other week for at least 6 months.

Intervention: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to the 'TDM-guided subcutaneous vedolizumab de-escalation' strategy versus 'standard care' (e.g. continuing standard subcutaneous vedolizumab dosing regimen of 108 mg every other week).

Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: cost-effectiveness of the TDM-guided de-escalation group compared to the standard dosing group over 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints include: proportion of patients with sustained clinical remission (based on Harvey-Bradshaw Index or Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index), proportion of patients with (sustained) biochemical remission (based on c-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin), pharmacokinetic differences (vedolizumab levels and immunogenicity), safety and quality of life (measured by SIBDQ and EQ-5D-5L)."

NCT06583980,INSELMA - a Randomised Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06583980,"Background:

Patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) experience substantial impact of their disease despite optimal pharmacological treatment. To be able to manage these challenges effectively, patients require tailored self-management support from various professionals. We thus developed a six-month nurse-coordinated interdisciplinary self-management intervention (INSELMA), in collaboration with patients, clinicians and managers. A pilot study on the INSELMA intervention in 18 participants showed promising results. It is now relevant to test the intervention and compare it to a control group in a larger study .

Objectives:

The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of the INSELMA intervention to usual care (control group), on health related quality of life measured at baseline and end of intervention (6 months after baseline).

Key secondary objectives are to compare the short and longer-term effect of INSELMA on changes in mental well-being, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, sleep, physical activity, global impact of the disease, work ability, self-efficacy for managing chronic disease and pain and health literacy relative to usual care from baseline to 6 and 12 months after baseline and on quality of life from baseline to 12 months after baseline.

Method:

A pragmatic randomised trial with a two-group parallel design.

All participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care only .

Both groups will receive usual care. The INSELMA intervention group will be assigned a coordinating rheumatology nurse who performs an initial biopsychosocial assessment. Based on the assessment, the nurse and the patient agree on which activities and goals to work towards for the following six months. The coordinating nurse can refer the patient to see a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist or social worker if needed and can help identify offers in the patients' municipality.

The primary endpoint will be change in quality of life from baseline to 6 month after baseline. Key secondary outcome measures are collected to compare the effect of INSELMA on changes in mental well-being, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, self-efficacy for managing pain, physical function, global impact of the disease, sleep problems and acceptable symptoms relative to usual care from baseline to 6 and 12 months after baseline."

Published experience with endovascular treatment is promising. However, its efficacy has not been confirmed and early selection criteria for EVT are unknown.

Objective:The main objective of the Endovascular treatment or Standard medical Care for Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (ESCORT) trial is to determine if EVT improves the functional outcome of acute and subacute CVST patients with multimodal imaging selection.

Study Design:The ESCORT trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial.

Study population: Patients are eligible if they have a radiologically criteria proven acute and subacute CVST, obvious symptoms of intracranial hypertension(lumbar puncture pressureâ‰¥250mmH2O).

Intervention: Patients will be randomized to receive either EVT or standard medical care (therapeutic doses of heparin). EVT consists of local application of alteplase or urokinase within the thrombosed sinuses, balloon angioplasty, and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Glasgow coma score, NIH stroke scale, ophthalmologic examination, Headache Impact Test-6(HIT-6), EuroQol-5 dimension-5 level(EQ-5D-5L) scale score, multimodal imaging and relevant laboratory parameters will be assessed at baseline.

Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion with good prognosis at 3 months (definition: a. mRSâ‰¤1; b. headache score (\<50, HIT-6); c. FrisÃ©n=0 grade for papilledema; d. defect of field vision PMD\>-2dB). Secondary outcomes are three-months mRS, HIT-6,FrisÃ©n grade for papilledema, situation of EQ-5D-5L, mortality and recanalization rate.

NCT06582576,Mechanisms of Action for the Enterra Medical Gastric Electrical Stimulator,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06582576,"Background: Gastric electrical stimulation applied by a surgically implanted device effectively alleviates upper gastrointestinal symptoms in the majority of individuals with medically refractory gastroparesis. Despite its efficacy, the mechanisms of action have been minimally explored in previous studies, and it is unknown why some individuals experience limited symptom-lowering effects.

Aim: The investigators aim to investigate two of the potential mechanisms of action leading to symptom-reducing effects of gastric electrical stimulation: 1) possible central effects in the brainstem and brain by enhanced parasympathetic vagal activity, and 2) peripheral effects in the stomach by improved gastric accommodation.

Methods: Up to thirty individuals with drug-refractory gastroparesis having an implanted gastric electrical stimulator will be enrolled in this cross-sectional and observational study. Of these, 15 will be responders (substantial symptomatic improvement) and 15 non-responders (minor symptomatic improvement). Electroencephalography (EEG) will evaluate the stimulation-induced activity in the brain and brainstem to assess whether the gastric stimulation generates evoked potentials. Electrocardiography (ECG) will investigate stimulation-induced changes in the autonomic regulation of the heart. Gastric ultrasound will investigate the effect of stimulation on stomach accommodation, contractions, and wall tension. These central and peripheral measures will be assessed during one study day before and after activating the gastric electrical stimulator, following an increase in stimulation intensity and post-meal consumption. Furthermore, results will be compared between responders and non-responders.

Perspectives: Adjusting the parameters of gastric electrical stimulation based on objective markers in the brain, heart, or stomach, rather than relying on symptom fluctuations, may enhance the effectiveness of symptom improvement. In the future, these objective markers may aid in differentiating between responders and non-responders, which may lead to optimised selection criteria for surgery."

NCT06582472,"Early Retinal Neurodegeneration As Risk Factor, Biomarker and Pharmacological Target of Diabetic Retinopathy",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06582472,"Despite the evidence that diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the first cause of blindness among the working-age population, it lacks a specific preventive treatment. This is because early mechanisms leading to the development of DR have been, until recently, unknown. Recent studies have suggested that the early stages of DR could be preceded by neuronal abnormalities, in particular retinal ganglion cell death, coupled with widespread retinal inflammation. According to these studies, endothelial dysfunction and the development of microaneurysms, the classic hallmarks of DR, could be the consequence of these early abnormalities.

This project will aim to verify whether neurodegeneration could represent at the same time: 1) a risk factor for subsequent development of DR (this will be investigated through a follow-up study in type 2 diabetic patients free of diabetic retinopathy). 2) a biomarker of the complication (if so, patients with long-standing diabetes in the absence of retinopathy should show no signs of neurodegeneration)."

NCT06580925,Effects of Dynamic Taping on Shoulder Isokinetics Strength and Muscle Fatigue.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06580925,"Maintaining shoulder stability requires good neuromuscular control. Imbalances in shoulder internal and external rotator strength may increase the risk of shoulder injuries in overhead athletes, and the compromised fatigue resistance of the external rotators may worsen this imbalance during sports activities. Additionally, poor scapular neuromuscular control is associated with shoulder problems, such as shoulder impingement syndrome. Previous research has shown that individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome exhibit poor scapular motion control and altered corticomotor control. Poor scapular motion control, pain, functional impairment, and changes in corticomotor control interact to form a vicious cycle. Various treatments have been attempted to improve neuromuscular control, including taping. Most past studies have focused on the efficacy of rigid tape and kinesio tape, while dynamic tape has gained popularity in recent years. Due to its material properties, dynamic tape is theoretically able to absorb loads, provide force, and correct movements. However, there is currently a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of dynamic tape. No research has yet explored whether dynamic tape can provide force to increase muscle strength and reduce fatigue or whether its movement correction functions can improve neuromuscular control and corticomotor control. Therefore, this project plans to conduct an experiment to investigate the effects of dynamic tape on external rotator strength and fatigue in recreational overhead athletes, as well as its impact on neuromuscular control and corticomotor excitability in recreational overhead athletes with shoulder impingement syndrome. In the experiment, 37 healthy recreational overhead athletes will participate in three testing sessions spaced one week apart, receiving kinesio tape, dynamic tape, and sham tape. After taping, they will perform fatigue-inducing activities. Isokinetic strength of internal and external rotators will be measured before taping, after taping, and after fatigue-inducing activities to observe the effects of dynamic tape on muscle strength and fatigue compared to kinesio tape and sham tape."

NCT06580847,Benefits of Choir for Older Adults with Unaddressed Hearing Loss (WP2),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06580847,"Unaddressed age-related hearing loss is highly prevalent among older adults, typified by negative consequences for speech-in-noise perception and psychosocial wellbeing. There is promising evidence that group singing may enhance speech-in-noise perception and psychosocial wellbeing. However, there is a lack of robust evidence, primarily due to the literature being based on small sample sizes, single site studies, and a lack of randomized controlled trials. Hence, to address these concerns, this SingWell Project study utilizes an appropriate sample size, multisite, randomized controlled trial approach, with a robust preplanned statistical analysis.

The objective of the study is to explore if group singing may improve speech-in-noise perception and psychosocial wellbeing for older adults with unaddressed hearing loss.

The investigators designed an international, multisite, randomized controlled trial to explore the benefits of group singing for adults aged 60 years and older with unaddressed hearing loss. After undergoing an eligibility screening process and completing an information and consent form, the investigators intend to recruit 210 participants that will be randomly assigned to either group singing or an audiobook club (control group) intervention for a training period of 12-weeks. The study has multiple timepoints for testing, that are broadly categorized as macro (i.e., pre- and post-measures across the 12-weeks), or micro timepoints (i.e., pre- and post-measures across a weekly training session). Macro measures include behavioural measures of speech and music perception, and psychosocial questionnaires. Micro measures include psychosocial questionnaires and heart-rate variability.

The investigators hypothesize that group singing may be effective at improving speech perception and psychosocial outcomes for older adults with unaddressed hearing loss-more so than participants in the control group."

NCT06580743,Efficacy Verification in Early Diagnosis and Management of Lymphedema Through Home Body Water Analyzer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06580743,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women. One in five women who have been treated for breast cancer develop lymphedema. Lymphedema is a very common result of breast cancer and its treatment. Lymphedema is the build-up of fluid in tissues, which results in tissue swelling. The lymph system is a network of lymph vessels, tissues, and organs that carry extra fluid from your cells/tissues throughout the body. If this lymph fluid is not able to flow in the body how it should, there will be swelling which can lead to lymphedema. It can be classified into stages 0 to 3 depending on the severity of the condition. Stages 0 and 1 are reversible, and through early diagnosis and treatment, the recovery to the normal volume and normal skin status of arms can be possible. On the other hand, stage 2 or higher is irreversible, and tissue fibrosis progresses and cannot return to normal skin; therefore, it is important to detect early and start treatment.

This is an observational longitudinal study. Potential participants will be recruited for follow-up after breast cancer surgery. Only patients who fit the inclusion criteria will be considered for participation in the study and contacted by the healthcare provider. Standard of care will be used to guide any treatment needed by participants while they are part of the study."

NCT06579820,Effect of Tubular Bandage Application on Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Usage Time and Infiltration in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06579820,"In pediatric patients, placement of peripheral intravenous catheters is the most commonly performed invasive medical procedure. In addition to the administration of medications, parenteral nutrition, intravenous fluids, and blood products, peripheral intravenous catheters are placed prophylactically before procedures and for emergency use in unstable patients.

One of the most common complications of peripheral intravenous catheters is infiltration. Infiltration is a vascular trauma resulting from a lesion in the vascular layers and subsequent perforation, resulting in the leakage of medications or non-vesicant solutions into the tissues surrounding the site of placement of the peripheral venous catheter.

In pediatric patients, physical factors (e.g. hyperactivity, sweating), tight fixation (may affect blood circulation and iatrogenic skin injury), loose fixation (may cause peripheral intravenous catheter displacement and infection), poor-quality fixation (may cause unplanned removal and skin injuries due to pressure), etc. causes more peripheral intravenous catheter fixation problems in pediatric patients than in adult patients Additional fixation products may be effective in preventing dislocation and micromotion in an active pediatric patient. However, limited recommendations regarding medical adhesive tapes and additional fixation products are guided only by low-evidence studies.

In addition, is the main risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. It is estimated that around 50% of the Argentinean population is infected with H pylori. The optimal management of H pylori remains unclear. In Argentina, most treatments are prescribed on an empiric basis, unaware of the bacterial antibiotic resistance profile.

Meta-analysis showed that susceptibility-guided treatment is not better than empirical treatment in first and second line treatment therapy if the most effective local regimens are prescribed. Updated information concerning local data is needed to design the best strategy to treat H pylori infection in order to reach high eradication rates and to introduce the principles of antimicrobial stewardship to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.

The Argentinean Registry on H pylori (ArgReg-Hp) management was launched in May 2021 in order to obtain a large and representative sample of routine clinical practice of Argentinean gastroenterologist. Its main focus was to identify therapies that are highly effective and can be used empirically.

i. The addition of a box which allows a stem to be inserted into the femoral canal; ii. The addition of screw lugs so that augments can be placed on the distal and posterior resections, and; iii. The box which also allows various levels of constraint to be added to the polyethylene insert. The tibial component offers the ability to place augments.

Indications for Use:

The GMKÂ® Total Knee System is designed for cemented use in total knee arthroplasty if there is evidence of sufficient sound bone to seat and support the components.

This knee replacement system is indicated in the following cases:

* Severely painful and/or disabled joint as a result of arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or polyarthritis
* Avascular necrosis of femoral condyle
* Post traumatic loss of joint configuration
* Primary implantation failure
* Ligamentous Instability

Tibial augments are to be attached to the tibial baseplate with both the fixing cylinders and bone cement. In case a semi-constrained liner is used, an extension stem must be implanted both on the tibial and on the femoral component.

GMKÂ® Revision femoral components are manufactured of Cobalt Chromium Molybdenum (CoCrMo) according to ISO 5832-4:1996, Implants for Surgery- Metallic materials - Part 4: Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum Casting Alloy, the same as the GMKÂ® Primary femoral components. They have an asymmetric patellar groove (left and right) with different radii of curvature in coronal plane as well as non-parallel anterior and posterior cuts (wedge shape). The GMKÂ® Revision posterior stabilized femoral components are designed for use without cruciate ligaments when additional stability is required to prevent subluxation of the femur to the tibia in flexion, same as the GMKÂ® Primary femoral components.

In case of severe bone loss, the tibial cones and femoral cones may be used to respectively reinforce the proximal tibia cavity and the distal femoral cavity, providing structural support and load redistribution on the remaining bone. Being an integral part of revision TKA for patients with such bone loss, the clinical outcomes for revision TKAs using the cone components are important for the knowledge regarding performance and survivorship of the Revision TKA as a whole."
NCT06578793,Comparison of Catheter Plus Marshall Vein Ablation vs. Catheter Ablation Alone in Persistent AF With Heart Failure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06578793,"This multicenter, randomized controlled trial aims to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of combining catheter ablation with Marshall vein ethanol ablation versus catheter ablation alone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant heart failure. Persistent AF is a common arrhythmia that significantly impacts the quality of life and survival rates, especially when coexisting with heart failure. While catheter ablation is a standard treatment for AF, its effectiveness in persistent AF, particularly in patients with heart failure, remains suboptimal. The addition of Marshall vein ethanol ablation may enhance treatment outcomes by targeting arrhythmogenic substrates. This study will enroll 120 participants across three centers to evaluate whether this combined approach can reduce AF recurrence, improve heart function, and enhance patient outcomes compared to catheter ablation alone."

Prevention and adequate treatment are, therefore crucial. While Nepal has made significant improvements in maternal and neonatal health, these efforts are insufficient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3. Several studies have revealed critical gaps in the knowledge and clinical skills of maternal and neonatal health (MNH) providers in Nepal, likely due to limited clinical experience and practical exposure. Therefore, One Heart Worldwide is implementing the 'Maternal and Newborn Health Simulation Lab Centers of Excellence' project in 7 referral hospitals of Nepal wherein in simulation labs will be established and simulation-based training will be provided to hospital staff with a focus on essential care of labor and birth, bleeding after birth, and helping babies breathe modules. This implementation study will evaluate the project implementation and effectiveness using a REAIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. A mixed-methods approach will be used to evaluate each component of RE-AIM using a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design. The pre-test data collection will be of 6 months' duration. During this phase, the investigators will collect daily data on maternal and neonatal health outcomes (Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) incidence, proportion of newborns with APGAR score\&amp;lt;7 at 5 minutes' assessment, and rate of maternal blood transfusion after PPH), and also assess the skills assessment scores of the MNH service providers. After the completion of pre-test data collection, training will be provided to MNH service providers of the hospital in the established simulation labs. The daily MNH routine data collection will continue during project implementation phase, and till six months after the training MNH service providers of the hospitals. In addition to the assessments done in the pre-test, the investigators will also assess the reach, implementation status, challenges, utilization, and maintenance of established simulation labs.

NCT06577272,Title of Manuscript: Development and Internal-external Validation of a Comprehensive Model for Predicting Risk of Post-RFA Recurrence in HCC Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06577272,"Background A predictive model for post radiofrequency ablation (RFA) recurrence in patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that incorporates variables like sleep quality and psychological factors can provide more time to prevent the recurrence. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between these factors and post-RFA recurrence, and to construct a predictive model includes these highly preventable factors.

Methods We collected data from HCC patients who underwent RFA for the first time from January 1, 2015, to July 2023, assessing their sleep quality, anxiety, and depression levels. We employed Restricted cubic splines (RCS), mediation analysis, Cox proportional hazards model, Elastic network Cox proportional hazards, Competitive risk model to ascertain the relationship between these factors and post-RFA recurrence. We then constructed a predictive model incorporating these factors, and evaluated the model's performance through internal and external validation datasets partitioning by time period."
NCT06577233,Superior Hypogastric Nerve Plexus Block With Bupivacaine After Robotic Resection of Endometriosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06577233,"Endometriosis is a condition that causes significant pelvic pain and affects 10-15% of reproductive age women. Treatment options area both medical and surgical for pain relief, however with surgical options, past studies have demonstrated a higher risk of surgical complications as well as higher postoperative pain scores in women with endometriosis. Despite attempts to limit narcotic pain medications with enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, persistent opioid use after surgery is a national crisis, and it is important to explore multimodal options for pain relief. Various studies have shown improvement in pain with use of superior hypogastric nerve blocks in gynecologic surgery, but these effects have not yet been examined in the setting of a minimally invasive endometriosis resection.

The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a superior hypogastric nerve plexus block with 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride can decrease postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients undergoing robotic assisted resection of endometriosis for the first week after surgery.

Researchers will perform a superior hypogastric nerve plexus block by either injecting 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride (investigative treatment) or normal saline (placebo) in subjects who are undergoing a robotic assisted resection of endometriosis.

To determine if postoperative pain is reduced, the subject will be asked to rate their pain score on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 0 hours, 2 hours and 4 hours postop while in the Post-anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). They will then document their pain score each day on a form provided to them for 7 days after surgery.

To determine the effect of this research study on postoperative opioid requirements, the subject will be asked to fill out a form documenting how many tablets of an opioid medication they took each day for a total of 7 days after surgery."

NCT06576986,Effect of Synbiotic Supplementation on the Prevention of Mucositis in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06576986,"Introduction: In the 2023-2025 period, colorectal cancer (CRC) will be the third most common type of cancer in Brazil. The most commonly used therapeutic approaches are chemotherapy (QTx) and radiotherapy (RTx). QTx agents, such as capecitabine, affect both malignant cells and normal cells such as gastrointestinal, capillary and immune cells. Cellular damage in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) results in various symptoms, such as mucositis and diarrhea. Diarrhea is linked to mucosal damage and can result in dehydration, malnutrition and hospitalization, leading to cardiovascular complications and death. Mucositis is inflammation that affects the GIT. This condition makes treatment difficult, leading to reductions, delays or interruption of QTx. These scenarios harm the patient's prognosis and quality of life, resulting in high costs for symptom control, nutritional assistance, management of secondary infections and hospitalization. The Mucositis Study Group (MASCC/ISOO) guidelines recommend the use of probiotics as a preventive measure against diarrhea in cancer patients undergoing QTx and/or RTx. However, the safety of using probiotics in immunosuppressed patients is still controversial and hypotheses are based on epidemiological and experimental studies. This makes it necessary to evaluate whether supplementation with pro- or synbiotics before chemotherapy would have the same beneficial results. Objective: To evaluate the effect of synbiotic supplementation on the prevention, incidence and severity of mucositis in cancer patients undergoing QTx. Method: This is a single-center parallel double-masked randomized clinical trial to be carried out at the Borges da Costa/UFMG Outpatient Clinic at Hospital das ClÃ­nicas in Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais (HC-BH/MG). The inclusion criteria are patients diagnosed with CRC eligible for first-line treatment with Capecitabine, aged â‰¥ 18 years, both sexes, signed the informed consent form. The study was approved by CEP-UFMG. Expected results: It is expected that supplementation with synbiotics in the pre-QTx period will promote modulation of the microbiota and strengthening of the intestinal barrier, resulting in a lower incidence and severity of mucositis and diarrhea, improving the quality of life of these patients."
NCT06576973,Adbelimumab Combined With Chemotherapy and Apatinib in Patients With Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06576973,"Esophageal cancer is a prevalent digestive tract tumor, with around 400,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths globally each year. In the past few decades, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other treatments were continuously improved, however, the mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients was not significantly decreased. For patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, direct surgery is not effective. It is difficult to achieve radical resection by surgery merely, and even if many patients receive surgery, they may eventually have tumor recurrence and poor survival rate.

Therefore, it is necessary to explore effective perioperative neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and improve the postoperative survival rate of patients. According to the reports, the expression of PD-L1 in esophageal cancer was about 41.4%. Therefore, PD-1/ PD-L1 immunocheckpoint inhibitor may become a new method for the treatment of ESCC. Preliminary clinical results showed that immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy provided a synergies antitumor effect.

The results of the Phase 1b trial evaluating adbelimumab monotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced resectable ESCC demonstrated that patients receiving two cycles of neoadjuvant sequential surgery exhibited favorable safety profiles, with no adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher. The trial reported a major pathological response (MPR) rate of 24%, a pathological complete response (pCR) rate of 8%, a 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 92%, and a 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate of 100%. The effectiveness of combining adbelizumab with chemotherapy and targeted therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer is uncertain.

This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of using adbelizumab with chemotherapy and apatinib as neoadjuvant therapy for resectable ESCC."

NCT06576557,Knowledge Translation and Exercise for Degenerative Meniscal Tears and Early Osteoarthritis: KNEE-DEeP Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06576557,"Knee pain due to a degenerative meniscal tear (DMT) or early osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent presentation in middle-aged and older adults. In the knee joint a DMT can occur normally with age, but is also associated with the continuum of knee OA. Exercise is recommended as the main treatment to aid recovery, while an arthroscopy (camera in the knee) to remove torn cartilage does not provide any additional benefit. Despite this many patients in Ireland with this type of knee pain are referred to an orthopaedic surgeon by their GP, and do not receive recommended care from their physiotherapist.

The first phase of this project designed the KNEE-DEeP (Knowledge Translation and Exercise for Early Degenerative Knee Pain) intervention to deliver better care to patients with DMT and early OA. The overall aim of this feasibility study is to test the KNEE-DEeP intervention to ensure it can be delivered as planned and it is acceptable to patients, and health care professionals (HCPs) involved in intervention delivery; GPs and physiotherapists. This is in preparation for carrying out a larger future trial.

As part of the intervention, GPs and physiotherapists will receive an educational workshop. Patient participants in turn will receive an 'enhanced consultation' from their participating GP and a 'best practice' physiotherapy session focusing on strategies to enhance self-management. This approach will be tested out by enrolling 15 GPs, five physiotherapist and 36 patients in the feasibility study. Patients will be followed up after 12 weeks and six months to track their progress. As part of the evaluation all GPs, physiotherapists and patients will complete questionnaires and a sub-set will provide more in-depth feedback via interviews conducted over the phone or online."
NCT06576505,Immunological Mechanisms in Sarcoidosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06576505,"There is no cure for the inflammatory disease sarcoidosis. Virtually any part of the body can be affected but most often the lungs and lymph nodes. Outcomes after diagnosis vary widely among sarcoidosis patients, with some experiencing resolving disease and others developing chronic disease and lung fibrosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to life threatening arrythmias and calcium metabolism disturbances can lead to renal impairment.

Treatment with different forms of immunosuppressants are usually tried to dampen symptoms but are not effective in all patients. Furthermore, the disease usually flares up after cessation of treatment. The variability in diseae course and treatment response is thought, at least to some degree, to be explained by individual differences in genetics, immune cells and signaling pathways. But existing evidence is limited. In other inflammatory diseases the gut microbiome is of importance for disease course but its role in sarcoidosis has not been clarified.

In this prospective project the investigators will study genes, inflammatory cells and signaling molecules in the lung, upper airways and blood, and to some extent microbes, also in faeces. Healthy volunteers will be included for comparative studies. Most samples will be taken during normal diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with/with suspected sarcoidosis. The findings will be correlated to disease course and effects of different treatments. By linking to national health data and demographic registries, comorbidities and environmental factors will be correlated to data.

By this, the investigators hope to improve understanding of which genes, cells and signaling molecules that are of importance for resolving vs non-resolving disease and why some patients respond to a certain treatment and others donÂ´t. The overall goal is to assess and predict sarcoidosis outcomes. We hypothesize that blood-based biomarkers including those taken during routine care as well as novel cell, signaling molecules and genetic markers, in combination with clinical characteristics can be used to predict outcomes, also treatment response, in sarcoidosis. The results can lead to tailored treatment and individual follow-up for each patient with sarcoidosis."
